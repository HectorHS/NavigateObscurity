ShareExp,,,,,"My friend's aunt had corona but i dont know her personally no No noone i know has it my family friend passed away from the virus; about 1 week ago. He was admitted in hospital for something else and catched the virus within his ward. Some people have been tested due to being frontline; most haven't No; nothing If you recover; check your respiratory system I think I have experienced COVID-19 but did not show any sever symptoms. My symptopms are easily confused since I have severe allergies. Two of my daughters had ongoing low fevers for a few days after the new year. They didn't have symptoms of flu or cold. No sense of smell or taste The most likley time they contracted it was before it was supposedly in my region my friend went to northern Italy in the middle of the pandemic there and did not have symptoms (nor her husband she lives with) i don't know anyone that has it no. I think I had the covid but with no symptoms. My granddad was in hopsital with a burst appendix for several weeks; he contracted it in hospital a few weeks after the lockdown Both myself and my partner had the symptoms of the virus at Christmas time and were both really ill for almost two weeks but this was before it was officially announced and we have never been to China but we both had the same symptoms. Will be interesting to find out after we get tested to see if we had it. que hay una relacion directa con el tiempo de exposcion ; cantidad de virus infectada y sintomas ; la edad es relativa aunque hay que ponderarla A friend It concerns me that someone I know who thinks they have it hasn't remained in isolation some don't want to be tested because the government seems to be lying about numbers and only picking people that will be negative in most cases Cases are to as high in my country yet. Most people are social distancing and working from home I was tested for COVID-19 yesterday and I am waiting for the results. Several work colleagues swabbed positive but fortunately none were seriously ill I think I don't have it; and I'd be happy to volunteer for clinical tests. Don't panic; just carry on as normal Even though its likely my roommate and I had it; its impossible to get tested unless you know someone positive. I would like to see much more testing it is possible that I or someone I know  has it or has had it but have been asymptomatic The person I know who contracted COVID is a friend located in France. She is only 36; mother of 2 including a 5-month old baby. She had had a pretty bad flu late february so her immune system was weakened and she contracted Covid mid-March. She didn't know where from she got it. It was pretty violent as she had to be hopitalized for a little bit; she's fine now though. I know someone coded to have died COVID-19 when they tested negative for it It is not a common flu; much more could have been done since the beginning I am terrified of of teaching convid No the person I know who most likely contracted Covid lives in the Netherlands; got sick at home but never tested as per that country's policy to only test people who are admitted to hospital. no not anything I can think of I only know about a woman living in a town next to mine; who contracted COVID-19 during holiday in Italy and then passed it on about 8 people in the town; including her daughter No. A couple of colleagues believed they had it; but the UK has issues and shortages with testing so they don't know if they did actually have it. The office was closed and deep-cleaned immediately as a precaution; 2 weeks before the official UK lockdown on 23/03/20. 2 older relatives of mine had it who are high risk and they're luckily recovering. I had a dry persistent cough that lasted just over a week a week. I stayed at home I hope this wont last more. Good luck to all of us. Please watch yourself and others no Working at a Hospital I know some infected people; but none in my closer circle of coworkers. My sister thinks she's got it asymptomatically. We do not live in the same house. But my housemates have seen her while she could've been infected. A friend is 7 weeks fighting this disease I'm worried for myself and my loves ones and I hope this pandemic doesn't last for too much longer. I know two people who have likely contracted COVID-19 - one was tested; and one was not. Both are in their twenties and recovered but were very ill for a few weeks. i am not totally sure but me and and my are working from our home; we have a baby of two years and we don't be risky hasta el momento no conozco a alguien cercano que haya contra????do covid-19 no I know no one who has it but I know a few people who have been designated high risk. Some people may carry the Disease and not know it due to their immune system being very good and its able to fight it No Keep calm and stay at home; follow the instructions to stay as healthy as you can and don't panic. It???????s a scary virus that no one knows enough about. Stay strong; have courage; it will pass and you will be healthy again no Stay at home. The sooner we starve this virus out; the sooner the world can return to a semblance of what normal once was. stop worrying about it. our scientists are fantastic. I'm scared about my friend who works as a nurse and has been working double shifts. She has diabetes I; injects insulin and belongs to the risk group. Hope she will stay healthy. We must be careful; and very easy to be contaminated No one from my friends or family had any symptoms that might've indicated COVID-19. My cousin who is now recovering from it was extremely ill with it for 3 weeks. Who had it and symptoms were severe they were really suffering without any medical assistance No Although those I know with it have recovered; it gave me a first-hand understanding of the reality of this pandemic. No It???????s a scary process to be a part of I don't have any contact with my co-workers since I've been furloughed so it's possibly one has it and I don't know. Roommate started exhibiting cold symptoms; but it turned out only to be a common cold. I had a bit of a cough; went to the emergency service and was told i had to be tested because i had one of the symptoms. I got tested and came back negative. Well the person I know lives in Japan but travelled through the US prior to his testing positive No my sister is a midwife and had symptoms but has not been tested. My cousin who lives with an NHS employee also had symptoms but has not been tested. I dont know someone who have covid19. The girl I know that had the virus walk off work for two weeks and the straight back into work. Please; we need help; people is sick and die I work in a hospital where were the virus was detected in some patients. We are somewhat protected with masks; but because of the possible contact with the patient I was tested and I was negative. (I never had any symptoms). My husband may have had it or; despite immunization; we had a flu-like infection (fever; fatigue; but no runny nose) Not really. I've been in my home for more than a month; so I think I'm doing my part and reducing my odds. No No no The person I know who is Covid positive is a teacher at school. I have not seen her personally Its scary No; I don't know anyone that has had COVID-19 The city where I live is small; and the number of cases has been controlled. It is possible that at some point in the future they'll lose control of the positive cases; but for now it seems safe. My dad and I were VERY sick in february. He couldn't breathe and was in the hospital for a month. I was unable to do anything for myself for two weeks. We are waiting to see if they get a test for someone who has had it already. One of our cats was very sick at the same time.... i dont know anyone who has contracted it Nothing Family friend contracted COVID-19; came down with something resembling a strong flu. Said person tested positive; and remained in quarantine no The person I know successfully recovered without hospitalization. My friend is in quarantine because she's a possible case. She's a doctor. people who expose themselves are shit I have to avoid my friends who are in medical school and it's very hard Both my self and husband have hsd moderate synptoms. Still have no smell or taste 2 weeks later la I started showing symptoms just over 2 weeks ago. My partner (who I live with) has shown possible mild symptoms. He has not been given a test though as he is not a key worker and only those who are key workers or who are hospitalised are tested. The infected person I know never developed major symptoms They died Stay home in quarantine good friends brother is a doctor; so he got infected; but I did not meet up personally with this friend we only talk on the phone I wish more people would practice social distancing and wash their hands regularly. I think it's very serious but we shouldn't panic that much Not any I'm pretty sure people I know are wise enough to follow the guidelines to stay at home and social distancing. no I don't know anybody who suffered from COVID-19. There is circulating a lot of unchecked and opposed news related to the COVID-19 pandemic. - not really Be strong; we shall survive and be better humans The school in front of us(Salesianos) had some staff that tested positive and we have many students from that school. So; I think the children might have carried it to us but again it is not certain and I never had the symptoms That I hope that people take care of themselves and that they don't die pandemic also means chances No No I am possibly in higher-risk due to another condition; but not enough evidence is gathered. a friend father had covid 19 he was about 60 and now he is recovered No Since I live in a really big city (Milan - 1.5 million people) and contact with others is almost inevitable; I believe it is possible I may have unknowingly come in contact with someone with Covid-19 I hope the NHS starts making better informed decisions in the future. i have not idea if myself or anyone else has it, no one has been tested IDK if that person have covid 19 then it came from the hospital Not really. If we haven't been tested then it is hard to know; we could be silent carriers I do not know anyone that has the virus. Everyone is loosing their heads too much Based on the experience of people I know that contracted COVID-19; if you are young it affects you more in a psychological level tnhan a physical one; because you are in domiciliary arrest (like everyone else in the country); but you cant see your own family or friends that live with you; being totally alone in your room for weeks. They were OK but I am worried about getting to the pink frothy lung stage on a ventilator I'm not extremely worried and don't want to be; there's already too many people panicking No thank you There is one person infected in my neighborhood A friend's uncle in italy died from Covid 19 No It was better if the possibility of making the tests whore more easy and cheaper than it is. It is very scary and upsetting as you want to help but know that you can???????t. No I know that this crisis will be over sometime; we just have to stay hopeful. They should have stayed at home... Yes; she's having covid; but does not feel bad at all I haven't been tested since I have little symptoms; I think this is pretty common Nope no No Every potential symptom is a worry and it is sometimes unclear if you have it and are lucky to have mild symptoms or if the symptoms are non related and you should still be very worried No My grandmother contracted the virus. She's in her 90s and in a medical rehab facility The person I know died of COVID-19 I would think that someone who has contacted the covid-19 wouldn't be able to breath properly and difficulty in Socializing again in the future. dont panic and self-quarantine I don???????t know someone who is infected A friend in the USA has it. She is in her 60's and has a mild case so far the grand daughter of my neighboor had contracted COVID19. She is young ( student ) and didn't have to good to hospital though. I had a strange respiratory condition with mild symptoms but without fever I am a physician so I have contact with many patients. The elderly have a though time with the disease. These days are gloomy. A friend of mine found out yesterday that he likely has COVID-19. He's waiting for a second confirmatory test; but he thinks he has it. He works at a lab where they do COVID-19 testing; so it's not all that surprising that he became infected. None I don't want to have COVID-19 because i live with my grandparents no No The person who has covid had a mild form and is doing ok I don't know anyone who has or may have COVID-19. I do feel confident that I can overcome it if I do get infected though. my friends son who is a paramedic My cousins husband was in hospital with after developing viral pneumonia. Has since left hospital with antibiotics none I had gotten my flu shot back in October; so when I was mildly sick in early February I was ""surprised"". Now I'm thinking it wasn't the flu at all. I have no idea if I've contracted Covid-19 as I haven't been tested! The information I have is that medical assistance by phone has been regular. Friend says during the night the symptoms are worse to bare. Nothing specific No As far as we know; no-one in our family has had Covid-19 so far No I do not personally know anybody who has had or possibly had the virus. I'm a natural hermit I have nothing to say about In my local community it would probably cause people to freak out and keep it to themselves until the symptoms are apparent where they would blame someone else for it. You may think you have had it; but unless you have been tested you might have had a bad cold. COVID-19 is not as dangerous as they want us to believe; 90% pass it as a flu and less than 2% die; also for people my age the mortality is 0.1%. So let's rest assured I personally do not know anyone who have or might have contracted COVID-19. No The virus is exploited to impose new taxes and change society and the economy. No As a medical student and having my internship canceled; I cut off contact with all colleagues who are working so as not to spread anything from the hospital to the outside community. In general; all people took these measures; there have been enough individual protection kits (masks; gloves; gowns) that allowed the spread to be contained. However; I have infected colleagues who are currently quarantined. She lost her taste and smell for a few days; and had a blocked-up feeling but no other symptoms The people I know that got it didnt really have any symptoms. They feel fine now. My partner's mother and brother believe they have both had covid 19 and that it isn't actually that bad. My partner and I don't believe they have had covid 19. avoid other people. Don't be selfish  At the beginning of the crisis; we were really worried we have Covid-19; so any symptoms we experinced; we quickly connected them with Covid-19. They recovered I hope that Trump does not reopen the country prematurely. no people I know contracted covid are nurses/work in hospitals I had a dry cough a couple of weeks ago; and a slightly  raised temperature for 2 days; checked and verified by my daughter who is in lockdown with me He should be more careful. no I think people should stay inside more than they are I had an extremely sore throat for over a week; but it could have been a massive coincidence I am at home and I go to work only. No social contact I'm more worried now that the virus numbers are high that I Will catch itl I'm also worried that there will be a new strain of the virus coming next Yes My dad has it As far as I am aware I have not come into contact with anyone who has contracted COVID-19; and I have been staying at home as much as possible; therefore I would say that there is very little chance of me catching it No; I don't know anyone having COVID. the person I know was very ill.made it seem more real i have a kid i went to high school with say he has it on facebook no I don't have any symptoms; I have got a mild case of cold at one point. I don't know anyone who got COVID-19. I do not know anyone contracting COVID-19. I have been on voluntary quarentine for 32 days. The day I started this there were around 1000 cases but I suspected the growth would be exponencial. Prevention is key. Stay home; stay safe. Stay everyone at home don't make risks; only leave the house for buying food on the supermarket. Don't panic. I dont know Keep strong because we are one thing. i have ms so if i get covid i would be in trouble; but im not stressed about it there is nothing to share It is my nephew and he is a new born I have been staying home as much as possible. I have a lot of sick people in my family nie Someone at work showed the symptoms of having COVID-19 but never got tested for it I don't know anybody. I had a very unusual cough which disappeared after 7 days but no temperature; a couple of evening at the start I felt very tired and went to bed early; that is all. The cough was dry and very deep down in my chest. Definitely had the impression that if it had been worse it would have affected my breathing. no no I think people should be more responsible; specially elderly Not really. I only know a baby that as covid-19; and its very difficult for the family to deal with the sick baby; since they know they could get too No; thank you. We have no idea if we had covid or not. My sister had some fever after seeing a friend from a really hit zone and I had a cold more than one month ago after having flight overseas so it could be but testing is not available for everybody; probably we did not but who knows I'm not worried about myself but I'm very serious about not infecting at risk people;  esp my dad who is a health worker to start with; so i mainly stayed at home It's a huge responsibility especially for people living with other family members my cousin had covid-19. he is a GP but he has now recovered.  it is a worrying time; No They are relatively young and not part of a risk-group; they showed mild symptoms and it took 2 - 3 weeks for them to recover to the extent where they could go back to work. My brother (31) had COVID-19 and it passed without any problems Nothing to add It???â????????????????????????s hard to know of someone has it I dont think so I haven't people around me with COVID-19 I hope nobody from my family gets the disease stay strong avoid negativity No. I have been social-distancing so I hope I do not have covid19 No We are all trying to stay at home as much as possible; but it affects our mental health. I have no symptoms at all No; but I'm personally working hard such that I do not contract the virus. no No nothing at all. I don???â????????????????????????t know anybody personally who has had it and I have not had it. I think its mainly Media panic and COVID-19 is lethal as many other things. no.. I had to pick up my wife's sister flying back from Ontario 10 days ago and they have to stay home for 14 days so I am doing everything with extra care for now Had symptoms but told to stay home and Was not tested My boss went to hospital with breathing difficulties and was sent home without being tested There are not enough tests in this country to know if I or anyone else has had it. I've had no symptoms so I'm assuming I haven't had it but who really knows. I am isolating myself as much as possible; however my flatmates are not taking quarantine seriously and keep having friends over so I'm quite concerned about catching the virus without even leaving the house. No Had a debilitating cold mid-Feb; had to sleep sitting up because I couldn't breathe if lying down.  If not covid-19; it was one of the worst colds I have ever had. I am worried that my family members will get it. - No. my symptoms were mild. I and a colleague taught somebody whose father was very unwell with COVID-19. she also had COVID 19 syptoms no we have to rake care; i think this could be very serious. Stay safe! NO I know I could contract it; but so could I get sick with a dozen other illnesses. Well; I'd like to send all my love and support to all people who are going through it. Do self lock down. No Social distancing is the most important part and people are often failing on that I know one family which was under a quarantine; and one of the family members was seen outside of the house; he just break that. I don't know any; fortunately I have crohns desise and my mom h???â????????????????ve heart problems and we are careful right now Nil Not at all. no They would cough a lot and claimed to have a high fever but despite that still went out into public places. I would like to say just follow the general instructions which we see all over social media and keep social distance for the sake of your ownself and the sake of others i would like to know if i have had it and was asymptomatic; so i would hope when the crisis is over to able to be tested Nope I know several people with symptoms; but they were unable to receive testing so no clue who really has it. no a online friend of mine has his grandma in the hospital and he hopes she'll get better but it's certain that she'll not survive this. I feel sad; because so many people are left alone when they die. I hate it. Covid19 is terrible & we need to do all we can to stop the spread People just need to take this more seriously. If you don't care about yourself getting sick; worry about those around you. My girlfriend I live with is working at a bar; so we are thinking that we both might have contracted COVID-19 (her at work and myself from her) and that we are just lucky to go through it symptomless. We cannot test ourselves; the tests are too expensive. No I had many symptoms and was unwell but wasn???â????????????????????????t eligible for testing. It???â????????????????????????s frustrating not knowing if I have had it or not as if I had it I would possibly have some immunity. Staying at home is the most effective one can do when perceiving any of the suspected symptoms. I'm just staying home trying to do my part Stay Safe Im a programmer; so the covid didnt have much impact in my life Just that I'm not sure if I'm at at-risk person. The most vulnerable members of our society have had a letter from the government mandating that they stay inside; but there are still those of us with milder respiratory illnesses such as asthma who aren't sure what to do. Not really; but to all the victims: stay strong That she experienced a heavy cold that physically wiped her out for almost 12 days and that she worked in a hospital setting and was able to self isolate with her family at home for 7 days my friend's parents got tested positive; I'm talking with him online everyday and he is not sick for now Stay home Is a silent disease.... My friend who has it just lost is olphact.. Nothing more...... none I don't know anyone that might have Covid-19; my town is almost corona free (only 1-4 cases) Prior to the lockdown this person who had Covid 19 travelled to  Newcastle to fly to Bermuda to embark on a cruise. When he arrived he was informed the cruise was cancelled and offered return to the UK on the ship which was to be berthed at Southampton. He arrived at Southampton and returned by coach to Newcastle. He then drove home. Thank you It would be scary because we don't know how to act in these cases. We are afraid. We are just trying to stay alive Anyone with the slightest symptoms should be tested; so we can be better informed about who has recovered and how widespread the infection has been so far. No No I know two people with it. One spent a week in hospital the only thing that i have been doing is social distancing and keeping my hygiene and surroundings in check to avoid contracting the virus. My aunt got it The person I know; had no symptoms at all No I think there's not since I don't know anyone who even might be in the group of risk. I was referred to the covid-19 team on the phone by the hospital but they werent testing anyone apart from those who needed hospitalisation No. No One colleague had all the symptoms but never made the taste My one friend could possible have coronavirus because he was in quarantine with his dad No My friend got sick because her mom is a nurse and works at the hospital. I recently worked in a situation where I had to look after some quarantined people in a closed eniroment who had been in contact with covid-19 cases; the person who proposed me this job didn't took it seriously because everyone of them had done a serological test and they all tested negative. After two weeks we tested them again and 7 out of 20 were positive; luckly I received PPEs the second day I arrived there and after two weeks my work there ended and my swab test was negative. No no Not really; no No. Covid-19 is a serious issue because of its spread capability; but it is not fatal for healthy people. Stay home; flatten the curve! I had mild symptoms Well yes. It is better to keep their name in secret. People having COVID-19 in a smaller town; where there is only one infected should be in quarantine. And they should tell nobody that they may be infected. No one I know contacted or have COVID-19. no I'm doing all I can to stay safe For me it was just like a bad cold; symptoms weren???â????????????????????????t too dramatic no She feels good and has no symptoms Sometimes I hear my father saying; I might have Covid-19 as I don't feel well; but I'm pretty sure he got stress symptoms instead; as he doesn't even get out of home. He's fairly old and he's really afraid it seems. Nah Unfortunately; I do not have anything to share. no No. I don't know anyone who has it I just hope everyone follows the social distancing rules. If we all follow the rules now; we can be together sooner No My friend that had covid 19 is still positive after one month I can not fully say that I did not have / do not have COVID-19 as I have not been tested; but I do not have any symptoms and feel very good so I feel relatively certain that I am virus free. Even though it has not been 100% confirmed with a test. My dad owns a grocery store right under our house; so we don't need to go out as much to get supplies Have had two bouts of similar sounding illness - one in December so unlikely to be COVID and one in the last week which has some symptoms of COVID but only a few so probably not A friend of mine was showing symptoms but they self isolated and recovered without needing a hospital visit I had a friend with possible symptoms; in a city with known cases but she did not test. Cases in my country are very low. I used to be confident that if I contracted I would recover safely. I don't trust that anymore Public transport makes me anxious but i need to use it to get to work; from the approximetly 4 people everyday there's always a cougher I do not have any symptoms of COVID-19 and do not know anybody that possibly have it It can be terrifying knowing that my elder relatives are at such great risk My aunty may have contracted. No test for covid yet carried out. She is on a ventilator. My sister in law is a nurse and had a COVID scare but once tested it turned out to be negative My parents are nurses. They work in a clinic setting; so they don't have direct contact with COVID patients per-se. But they could. And they are in a high risk age group. I am worried about them. My in-laws are also high-risk due to age AND health related issues. They have less of a chance coming into contact with a COVID patient (retired; live in a rural community) but I also worry about them. I worry about going to the store and transmitting the disease to my toddler. I am currently in my student accommodation for university; and if someone is not careful enough when going out; I might get the virus even if I'm being very careful. i probably have never seen anyone who cantracted covid-19 stay at home Stay home It's my cousin who said she came down with it; and she is on the opposite coast of Canada. The only person I know that has covid-19 is an uncle in law. if you suspect that you have covid; better stay home and get tested :) My partner is a doctor; working at a hospital.. so the likelihood of contracting the disease or knowing someone who has contraacted it is high it is a silent killer that denies people of the basic human right of contact She didn't produce any sypmtoms for a week I believe. Then; out of nowhere; she started coughing a lot and had a sudden fever. She felt tired for a week and his body temperature was between 37 and 37.5 degrees. She didn't end up in hospital and she got tested negative last week again. I do not know anybody that has had it; I do know that my mum's boss had it and he was so scared he was going to prepare his will due to it being so bad for him. My mom is a nurse who has a COVID-19 patient; we are not sure if she has it. I go for runs when it's dark as there is minimal people outside but I still do meet some people. The person who contracted COVID-19 had extremely mild symptoms i do not know anyone with covid-19 The person I know who is infected went to a hospital with a pneumonia and came back infected they nearly died but after self-isolating and following guidelines she recovered It's been a slow ramp here in Mexico but it's definitely something to be worried about for the coming weeks.. Its a scary disease and china made it. They need to pay for this. I was very poorly , didnt get out of bed for a solod 5 days ans still dont feel 100% after 4 weeks ","some afraid of the world situation and how to deal to come again to work and live in society with others without vacines or medicines My uncle had the virus; while admitted in hospital and sadly passed away People have had symptoms but without being tested how can they be sure? I had allergy so I can easily confuse any sympthom with the ones I already have so unless it is really serious; I will not be going to hospital or take any tests. Wouldn???????t like to have it I am asymptomatic i think it is a pretty serious disease and everyone should take it more seriously Both myself were ill at Christmas time with the same conditions as the virus and were ill for some time but this was before the virus was officially announced. Es peligroso y mantener las distancias y medidas de seguridad I think closing the economy down is going way overboard; and I think the democrats want to destroy america. no one i know has contracted covid-19 yet I had most of the symptoms about 3 weeks ago. About a week ago; I got tested and the result was negative. However; I am still experiencing a rather nasty cough. A few work colleagues have had it but no one that I personally know has been seriously ill It was not a severe case; so everything is fine. A work colleague had it but I did not have physical contact with him My roommate is a bank teller; got sick; I got sick from him. May have been the flu; might have been covid. we do not have enough testing in NB or wide enough testing to determine how widely spread it was It is an aggressive disease Nothing. they are well now I don't have any particular experience Haven't heard anything new in my town about new COVID 19 cases Some colleage think they had it; but no UK testing on them. My friend's family member is currently critically ill in hospital from it. We'll possibly all get it at somepoint but we can beat it! my father tested positive but he doesnt have any syntoms Noone I know has been tested but have a lot of family/friends that had symptoms It was very scary seeing my friend have COVID-19 and I felt bad for the other people in their house i don't know someone who has covid. Stay strong My sister thinks she might have passed it asymptomatically Is complicated to make the virus disapear Please stay home and be safe Personally i dont know a person who had contracted covid19; just at the community where we live all the people; are using facial mask por el momento aun no existe caso alguno Both my wife have underlying conditions that make us high risks so we started isolation earlier than most. it seems to be mild or extreme - no in between Tests should be immediately available for everyone that could have Covid; nothing like ""if you do not feel very bad just stay at home"" No No I do not I don't rhink i know anyone having the virus I don't personally know anyone that has contacted SARS-CoV-2. It's ok. It's just a virus. you get over it in a fortnight. I was in 2 flights a few days ago. I am now asked to self-quarantine to make sure that I have not caught the virus. Nevertheless i have no symptoms so far. I communicate with my friends and relatives who belong to the risk groups and we share our worries. It makes it easier to tolerate the stress. Every time when I go out; I plan my route and make lists beforehand like I used to; but now it takes an extra 15 minutes to put on the protective measures; the mask and vinyl gloves and I'm still worried that I'm not doing it properly. I can do it it was ordinary flu for me but with greater  after effects No. I'm trying to avoid the risk of being infected as much as possible; I still don't go to any shops; churches. One of my cousins had covid and he was seriously sick for over 3 weeks. The person died because when he went to the hospital they sent him home; next day he collapsed and died 2days later No I dont know of anyone who might be having covid-19. I feel healthy too. At least two family members had symptoms last month; fortunately they have recovered. No one I know has been tested. Might be possible if someone has had it though because some people have no symtoms. No I'm starting to believe that even if people have had or have Covid-19 they are not telling others. my sister is a midwife and probably had COVID but they haven't given her an antibody test to find out Several neighbors get the diseasse; went to hospital to never be seen again I work in a hospital as a doctor. We have some positive cases in some patients and health care professionals. However; we were all tested; and the medical staff was negative. There are some relatives who don't always stay at home No I???????d like to know the serilogic test results My friend; firefighter; had covid-19 Scared to death about imediate family contacting it No the person I know that might have COVID-19 is from my extended family currently in Bolivia. It's hard to know if he has it because Bolivia does not carry out many tests and he had only mild symptoms. i dont know of anyone who has had or may have had covid19 No Need to be calm and follow instruction of SNS I don't think people are taking the risks seriously Of the multiple people I know internationally who contracted it; all recovered quickly. No Because of irresponsibility I know someone who has contracted it; but didn't develop major symptoms I believe at the beginning of this pandemic that I may have contracted covid-19 but dealt with it at home. I was given anti biotics for pneumonia & they really helped. That I really care about them and that keeping happy and possitive is better for your immune system and everything will be fine the only person I know who had covid-19 was a medical colleague. despite this; he had no symptoms I don't know anyone that has tested positive for COVID-19. I would advice them to be responsible and stay indoors. No I had the symptoms and so did my husband but I got tested three days ago and it was negative but I am still not 100% certain even though I was tested negative because I had the flu quite strong. Thus; I believe it might have been covid19; and sadly tests are not 100% reliable. No. stay at home and wear mask if you want to go outside; protect others also protect you. do not wear mask if you do hard sports. no No No They have said that it has been the worst flu they ever had No my friends father contracted covid 19 and she didnt even though they were living together There needs to be a lot more testing available to people! Am worried about my friends 14 yr old on a ventilator Nope. Nobody I know has got this He's ok now; and he contracted it before quarantine started in Spain In general; all the people I know that has got the COVID-19 (except the grandfather of a friend) have been lucky only having mild flu symptoms. no I am at higher risk. The people who contracted were fine; but the idea of disintegrating lungs is horrible This person live in my neighborhood Nothing important It is scary to watch your friend have it and not know what the outcome is going to be. i will not get COVID-19 Go outside only when its absolutely necessary and wear a mask. Social isolation in safety distance are important! I think there is a small chance people I know have had Covid-19 but only had very mild symptoms. No They lose their sense of taste; and they feel like the have the flu but they said it???????s actually fine (people aged 18-20) My uncle's wife (we live in the same building; different apartments) My grandmother passed due to complications of Covid. We should put our and others safety first. We can't be selfish nowadays; we have to stay at home. The man I know who contracted covid was a guard at a hospital They lost the sense of taste. I don???????t know infected people The daughter of my neighbor has had COVID19 I think it's unlikely that I had covid-19 since my symptoms were extremely mild (i.e.; mild cough; sore throat; no fever); but there seems to be more and more reports of people having mild symptoms so I guess it's possible. Well; a neighbor of my mother has contracted COVID-19; my mother hasn't been visiting for that reason my aunt contracted covid 19 and she is still with a virus. It seems like virus don't go away I have 2 friends that were pretty certain they had Covid 19 but were not tested so can't categorically confirm that they did. However; in their doctors opinion they did have the virus. anything no My uncle had it and so did  my cousins other half. The latter spent time in hospital with it The person I know was a relative and he died shortly after being hospitalized. As far as I am concerned I showed mild symptoms but it could not have been flu as I had had a flu shot (vaccine) in the fall I feel my memory is mixed up. Being isolated so long has put me in a situation of anxiety and lost track of time. No My father has been sent a test kit by his employer; but hasn't done the test yet. I have no personal experience of anybody with the virus A family friend who was relatively healthy and only in their mid 50s has passed away from the virus.  It is very sad situation and really made me respect what is happening no; nothing really. I'm a natural hermit I  have nothing else to share Not eligible In my country very few tests have been made so as to be sure of having had COVID-19. I have nothing to share No additional comments at this time. I think that everyone have to do all the necessary to avoid to have covid-19 No The pandemic in Portugal went better than expected; things are calmer now. Not really. I knew people who died from Covid; and I know a lot of people who had their loved one die of Covid Christmas time had symptom I????????m concerned as I have asthma so I????????m self isolating I????????m still very worried about the situation. In portugal; the government will reopen stores; beaches; and so on. I????????m worried about a second phase of the virus He suffered from that illness for 3 weeks but now he is fine most of the people i konow that contracted the virus work as nurses/in hospitals my sons friend has been very ill with it; needing ICU and ventilator...he has since recovered. He is only 27 no No I don't know anyone who have it; anyway my relatives do. no I had the worst sore throat of my life and it lasted a good 10 days or so Take care I think generally people have behaved sensibly the social distancing has been vital as a small minority still do not cover their mouth or nose when the sneeze or couch. This of course is the worst thing you can do to catch the virus even if some people can have just a few symptoms to the covid they should not feel like they and their family do not risk anything and can still go outside infecting everyone I had a friend; he was 44 years old and died of COVID-19 I don't know anyone having COVID-19. The person I know nearly died so it made me realise how serious it could be old friend on facebook said he had it No I don't know anyone that have COVID-19; but if I knew I would be very disappointed and blue. This is definitely a disease you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy. From the stories I've seen the days where you're sick are the worst of your life. keep strong I don't know anyone infected but I've heard that the disease is often asymptomatic so I'm never sure no It happens to anyone and the simptoms can be very light I was very sick in late january and early febuary with a cough and fever. I tested negative for the flu. I know that covid 19 wasnt here at that time but I wonder what it was. I live with a housemate that has underlying conditions; so we discussed our plan together. No Just to be clear; two weeks before my country had a lock down; I got pneumonia and had to stay in for two weeks. Then the pneumonia quarantine gave way to the covid-19 quarantine It's a bit of a bugger; and seems to navigate the body to find weak spots and then has a go and these. No My cousin who is a GP contracted covid 19. The person I know contracted mild symptoms but was not tested due to kit shortage and not being part of a risk-group. However; he has family members who have been tested positive. My brother was infected and survived the disease without any problems I can't know if I've contracted the virus; since I haven't been tested; and the virus could be asymptomatic. No nothing of importance I don't know a person who has COVID-19. Stay safe I don't know anyone with COVID-19 I had a cough but it wasn't dry; that is why I do not think I have COVID-19. My partner is a key worker No I don't know if I have had corona; it seems that no; cause my immediate family or I haven't had any symptoms; but I've heard there are people who don't have symptoms but have corona. No at all.. i dont want to share So far I've known no one personally who has contracted the virus nope No. I had to pick up relatives returning from other province about 3 weeks ago Have not been tested I know someone who says they have had it but they haven't been tested so not 100% sure My friend is a nurse; he contracted it but he is okay now. My next door neighbour's 92 year old father has died of Covid-19. No My mom is a nurse and she works with Infected and she thinks she already contracted because of some minimal symptoms; but tested negative both times No; because I don't know anyone like that No I do not No. The media caused an unnecessary panic I'd like to send them all my love and support to them so they go through this. None. Thank you Stay home So far no one that I know have contracted COVID-19 As far as we've been told; there may be many asymptomatic carriers out there; including oneself. Hence my replies here. Symptoms are some different from person to person that it's difficult to assess if I already have or not I take every precaution i can to ensure that nobody in my household including me gets the virus. No Well; I seriously hope I don't having in mind I have rinitis and my mom diabetes no It is scary since you do not know if you have it or not so you end up being more careful dont know someone The fact of the virus being silencie is very serious because you can be infected and never knowing; so every causion is needed No I don't know anyone having COVID-19 my mother in law has contracted it (aged 83), she appears to be asymptomatic Everyone I know that hd symptoms wasn't able to obtain testing in March a grandma of my friend is really ill now and we all hope she'll survive it is a terrible virus; and i hope the cure is soon found. Everything is so uncertain; it is almost impossible for the average person to get the information and help they need. I'm afraid of the variability of infected people; without knowing the criteria; without medicines my girlfriend works at a bar where people from all around the world show up. That is why I think she might have contracted COVID-19 (and if so; I have certainly contracted it from her); However; as of now; we did not have any symptoms of that. Nothing. I developed the symptoms. Felt like I had a cold for a few days then suddendly my temperature went really high followed by a terrible headache. Was drowsy on first bad day; second day still had terrible headache and temperature. Following days I developed a bad chest. Was refused test as not a key worker Symptoms vary so much that it????????s hard to decide whether I have had COVID or another illness Stay at home in order not to endanger anyone's life and prevent spreading the pandemic even more. I think some people I know are paranoid and think immediately they have COVID when they're just coffing a little No Person shared they lost their sense of taste and smell I don't think im at risk even if i take the covid No. Keep fighting Yes that is it something you can recover from even though it is a horrible condition to contract. It makes you extremely tired and the cough is also physically exhausting on the body I developed several of the symptoms; except I didn't have a cough. I felt unwell with a temperature; lethargy and sore throat; and tight chest and shortness of breath for about a week; which was a worrying time. Fortunately I started to feel better after about a week. Epidemics like this are usually more potent in the second wave. This is only the first; so I would ensure that everyone stays at home to prevent further deaths. I know him; but I had not contact with him for one year; we only talk through internet If you have any symptoms of COVID-19 just stay at home please Social distancing is the best prevention ! stay home No; I didn't contract neither someone I know I think I don't A cousin is now recovering from COVID-19. He is 76 and making slow but good progress No Family members did show symptoms and were unwell but were unable to get tested due to inconvenient testing stations; inability to drive to reach those stations;  and incompetent support of the government No; thanks aunt got it but she is good now The person who I know has contacted COVID has recovered without any serious symptoms Covid-19 is real; stay home I called 111 and they referred me to the covid-19 team who said it????????s highly likely that I have it but they aren????????t testing anymore No no On of my colleagues may have infected by covid19 Im not sure no My friend got sick because her mother who is a nurse contracted the disease at the hospital I have followed all goverment guidlines as have my family I had a cough and slight fever very early on in the Covid process but I will never know whether it was the virus or not. I ate raw onions and used almost every natural thing that supports the bodies defences. No. The goverment is not issuing tests even for close relatives of the infected person; the infected person in this case paid a private lab to check up on himself. I don't know anyone with COVID-19. My state has been on a shelter at home order since the beginning of April.  Only going out to shop for essentials; made sure I wore a mask and latex gloves; washing hand a lot more.  Keeping distance between me and other people when in public. Suffered from symptoms like a bad cold; runny nose; sore throat; couldn't speak. Felt really rough. none Not at this time She is fine with no symptoms Unfortunately; I have nothing interesting to share. No Been coughing on and off. Felt lethargic sometimes. Wonder if I caught a mild case of it At the beginning of the pandemic; i was sick with a sore throat and was sick for about a week. Other than that i am healthy. No. As many people who have COVID-19 might not show any symptoms it is theoretically that I or somebody I know has contracted it; but then again there has been no spread of the virus in my circle of friends and family so most likely we do not have it. No Had somethign that was very similar at the end of last year/beginning of this year which was before it was in the UK so assuming that it wasn't COVID-19 but incredibly similar symptoms. Just the fear of contracting this virus as there's so little knowledge of its repercussions I am not afraid of get sick I hope I don't contract it and I hope people who have it stay at home until they are free from the virus People in my grandfather's assisted living community are dying rapidly; and he is immunocompromised. It's terrifying. None I called the government-appointed line and told him about my symptoms; but they said that if I didn't have fever; they would not do the test exam on me. So I couldn't be tested. But the person I know that contracted COVID-19 didn't have fever (she tested positive). My veterinarian's father passed away from COVID-19. My parents are healthcare workers so I worry about them getting it. There are cases of positive tests in my city nope My cousin in BC who just came back from Mexico said she has gotten it My uncle in law was diagnosed. He is a doctor and now he is Covid-19 free I dont think so It seems like a very bad teem to contract; as it affect everyone differently. Hence; I am a bit anxious about contracting it. My partner is a doctor; working in the hospital; so i think its more likely that we contracted the disease My girlfriend was tested positive a few weeks ago; she had extreme dry coughing; tiredness and lack of smelling and tasting. The illness lasted 2 weeks. No The person I knew who had it only had very mild symptoms Stay strong Do not know anybody who knows anyone who has got it. Its much more dangerous than they let you know; and it says within your system. The doctor said i have had it but wasnt tested , i was very poorly for 3 weeks ","Only know of suspected cases; not confirmed by test i dont know anyone who has or has had it my family friend and unfortuntately he passed away in hospital. I know lots of people who had symptoms but how will we ever know if they had it? There is no one i know who has had covid-19 My strenght goes to you My coworkers probably got COVID but they have not been tested. It is possible my family was exposed in January. There was a lot of illness in my children's school; including two of my children. We have been pretty protected here and I don't know anybody that has tested or shown signs of the disease. I'd like to know for sure if I did have it no no I was asymptomatic Nothing they say the test is very painfull The friend who contracted it fully recovered. My granddad got it in hospital while he was already very ill; and a healthcare worker friend also got it Few people I know have had symptoms but no one has tested for it We were both ill at Christmas with similar conditions but this is before the virus. no tomaros esto a broma; es un virus que puede a llegar a fastidiar mucho;sigue co medidas preventivas I am grateful that my friend who has had COVID-19 has recovered despite being over 70 years old. not that I can think of. Depending on the person it may be a flu and on others it hits you like a truck and gets you bedridden. no one i know has covid 19 Nope! Some work colleagues contracred it; no one became seriously ill We need lots of tests. It's the only way to get things back to normal. about half of the other employees where I work were extremely sick in January & February with the 'Flu' which very quickly went into their lungs. They all said that they had never been so sick and they were all off work for several days plus. I know about the husband of a friend who just died because of it. Nothing at all because I have not experienced this to date. I don't know of anyone I know having COVID-19 - the only way they would have it at the moment is if they have it but are unaware. When I answered yes above I""m counting facebook friends (I have 1200) Very serious decease with a lot of problems No. No No There were some cases of COVID-19 in psychiatric hospital where my dad had a treatment; but he left about 4 months before the outbreak a few people at my place of work; at a hospital; have tested positive; but have recovered They were old and high risk; catching due to one being an essential worker; but survived. They're strong willed and we helped post them supplies. Nothing to say I suspect I also had it in dec 2019 when I had coughing fits My father was positive but neither my sister; me nor my mother tested positive It's hard thinking you've had the symptoms but not actually knowing for 100% I don't think i know someone having covid-19 My sister might have passed it asymptomatically since she was in contact with someone who is very possible that has had it. well i am leaving in a gated community and the people here stay at home and only go out just to go to the market or even to the work but some of them including me are working from home hasta ahora no no nothing to share as of yet. Tests should be easily available for everyone No Not as afraid as at the start. We know more about it now. I was shit scared about my friend; whose husband had to work in his office and received the news that a security guard had tested positive. He had been in close contact with him; he gave him the plastic taxi card and neither of them was wearing gloves. Fortunately my friend; her husband and son tested negative. The waiting was awful. No. - My cousin had it and was terribly sick for over 3 weeks. He???????s still struggling to completely recover They had a minor symptoms and nothing major happened. Nothing A couple of family members have thankfully recovered after experiencing Covid-19 symptoms. My friend who lives in the UK had symptoms but wasn't tested; we only talked online and didn't see each other in person I don't know anyone that has been tested. I think most of people might had it but without symptoms no - i didn't go out for nearly 2 months. I had a cough in March and my doctor sent me to the health services for a coronavirus test which came out negative It's no worse than the normal flu My sister is a midwife and probably had COVID but no way to know because they haven't rolled out an antibody test We are so scared; please find a cure not that I'm aware No No He's a firefighter I do not know anyone affected however know of two separate individual's whose grandmas have died of the virus Its scary I'm in a small town with few confirmed cases; so I don't think I contracted it. My family and I were extremely sick in January and February; my dad was in the hospital with breathing problems for 2 weeks. We thought it was just the worst flu case we had EVER had. Our cats even lost their voices and were coughing and sneezing for a week. Based on information about the virus; we believe this is what we went through. Hoping for a way to test if you have already had it; then we will know for sure. we know no one who has had it or even been tested One of my wife's uncles contracted COVID-19. They recovered quickly after being ill for a couple weeks. no myself and husband both had symptoms; but were not tested; just told to isolate It takes alot longer to recover from than the media are reporting. I wasn't hospitalised and although I'm not longer classed as symptomatic; I'm still fatigued with chest pain. The only case I personally know developed very mild symptoms Stay in home I know nobody that has tested positive having COVID-19. Be responsible about it I don't know no Some of my students must have it; because children carried it without knowing it Thank God they have recovered successfully. they are reported by news everyday they themselves suffer very seriously hurt both in mental and body. it was my friends dad; he had a temparture and cough it lasted 12 days and he stayed in his room; he cant remember most of it he was so out of it. Just found out a family member of a good friend died from COVID-19; I didnt personally know her but is related to a friend of mine No difference I have one colleague who was tested negative. my friend is waiting the result of covid 19 test so he is realy anxious no I have not shown symptoms but have has numerous customers come to work and mention that they're just getting over a case of it; or are living with someone that has it. im in the vulnerable category , my friend's son 14 yrs old caught the virus No body I know has this COVID-19 It seemed like a flu; but it's actually quite dangerous. Young people like me are relativily safe; but we must take care of ourselves to minimize the risk of infect older people. They all had it mild and have recovered. People that our acquaintances know may have had it worse It's not as likely as we probably think; but we still gotta be careful of course It's a person from my neighborhood Great aunt has a gastro strain of the virus I'm isolated in an island which has the lowest % of infected people in thw country; I believe we were lucky as I don't see a lot of people taking the correct measures to prevent further spread. Stay strong Just be safe at all times as it isn???????t worth the risk. The disease is not stronger than our collective will to defeat it. They contracted likely in a preschool nursery setting I think I know people who might have had Covid-19 but only showed mild symptoms There aren't enough tests; I hadn't enough symptoms no They survived it; and they said it???????s not that bad as they say in the media I feel as if my fiancee and I had the virus in early January. I know someone who is a confirmed patient and apparently they lost their sense of taste. I don???????t have anything to share my friend who has it is 59 years old living in Chicago I had a strange but not severe cold in early March. I had gone to New Orleans for a conference around that time and came down with this cold a few days after returning. It wasn't bad; but it wouldn't go away. I got a weird rash 3 weeks after my cold symptoms set in. I think it's highly unlikely that I had COVID-19 but it's possible. it is a scary thought to catch it. They neighbors of my mother contracted positive for covid-19 but didn't had any symptoms and they recovered quickly; that surprised me very much since. my aunt who contracted covid; was with him 2 months. Only now is it healed No I'm doing everything I can to not get the virus. They had to stay in hospital for a little while after contracting pneumonia My uncle died from Coronavirus-related pneumonia on March 12 I don't think I know anyone who has contracted COVID-19. My family and friends have generally been sensible following guidelines etc Family support makes a big difference in dealing with stress of those who contract the virus. Knowing there will be someone there to take care of us if we catch the virus makes it less distressful I??????????ve been selected to take part in a randomised COVID-19 test; will be taking tomorrow with results due back 72 hours from then Nothing comes to mind No I do not know anyone who has contracted COVID-19. A family friend contracted COVID-19 and has passed away due to complications. I know for sure I don't have jt i'm a natural hermit They feel very isolated and alone Stay calm and away from from everyone else I have nothing else to add No additional comments at this time no I think that the virus is too emphasized and is exploited in trade wars as well as for economic and social changes. No; there is nothing new to share. Someone have had it. He has mostly recovered but his taste is not back yet i really want to catch it and get it over with to be honest Uncle on dialysis and he recovered. it is not like a flu; the symptoms and the recovery are way worse nobody I know was infected by the virus I do not have any friends or persons around me who were infected with covid-19 medical staff are most likely to get the virus My sons friend from school (now 27) had covid and was moved from our local area to an ICU in a major city 2.5hrs away. He was on a ventilator but survived No thank you. My boyfriend's mother has contracted covid and it's been stressful knowing we can't take care of her. She's doing okay but it really hits home and keeps me up at night because covid affects everyone differently. I know people who know people that died because of covid 19 no As mentioned previously; I had an extremely sore throat for several days Keep safe. Stay at home. My main worry has been my parents both of whom have the underlying conditions that seem to be very dangerous if Coronavirus is caught.Thankfully though I am too far away to help they have good friends and neigbours who are looking afteer them no my friend died of covid; he was 44 years old No; I don't know anyone having COVID-19. it made the situation very real- its worrying i have facebook friends who say they have it No I don't know anyone; personaly; that has COVID-19. It is worse in the day 7-9 keep strong because you would recovered no comments The symptoms can be so light it is impossible to Know if they had covid without taking tests I was very sick in the end of January early february with cough and a fever but covid was not here at that time so it was probably something else. I worry about them; but they are gettting better I don't think I have had it; however; I may get it in the future as I am a key worker in a school. Well; I can say that my friend of around 60 yo had it for around two weeks and last time I??????????ve seen him; he has lost 20 kg of weight due to constant vomiting and diarrhoea Nothing else I had pneumonia 10 weeks ago but the hospital decided not to test me as I had no contact with anyone traveling abroad. At the time this was the general rule to save up tests. It's a nasty thing. It seeks weaknesses and attempts to exploit. This is a bit of a lurker. I don't think I know someone tested positive personally but for example the father of a dear friend risked to have it since he is a doctor and visited a infected patient without protections; friends of friends have it; the boss of my mum also had it I am scared to contract covid-19 The person I know has had mild symptoms for a few weeks and recently resumed working. He potentially has been infected at work or by family; some of his family members have tested positive for COVID-19. My brother was infected and survived the disease quickly and without problems. no The stress is much more destroying. Don't worry needlessly I don't know a person who has COVID-19 virus; so I can't say som about it. I think that since testing is still limited to symptomatic carriers; it's hard to discern whether you have immunity or not. no It is frustrating not being in the group that can get tested and yet exhibiting symptoms No I have no idea if I have had covid; because some people are asymptomatic. No; since nobody that I know of has the virus. I would't Nothing at all. I know nobody who has contracted it. No. Thanks no.. im very caution im actually a bit of germaphobe i take extra caution Had to pick-up a relatives that returned from Florida and had to self quarantine for 3 weeks in Ontario and then returned home to Newfoundland but they do not have any symptoms I know 2 people who texted posative and both are fine now There was a suspicion that one of my roommates had COVID-19; however it turned out to be something else. Had awful bout of flu-type cold mid-February; think it may have been Covid-19. I had very minor symptoms a couple of weeks after Easter. I ran a temperature; and had a sore throat; along with fatigue. It was gone in 24 hours though; so I really have no idea if I had it or not. well just be careful; not only with me but with everyone else Due to the fact that almost everyone has covid19 without any symptoms; even a slight cough or runny nose can be an infection. I have known 2 people who think that they had COVID-19 but both tested negative no relatives of close friends have died from covid; others are infected; it is so sad He recovered well. Well; I just want to give all those people who are going through this all my love and support. None Possibility of a second wave is scary Nothing to add. I know a few people who broke quarantine rule of being isolated for at least two weeks... They got it from working an essential job part of the supply chain for groceries There are people that says it is just a normal flu; but others reported loss of smell and taste. I was scared because I have weak immune system. None I don't personally know anyone who has contracted COVID-19; but I wish everyone the best of luck. It's all gonna be fine ! Stay strong ! Myself I don't have COVID-19 and I don't know anyone that could possibly have COVID-19 No I have been self quarantined Yes I had a flue and a headache; during this COVID-19. But Thankfully; it was not corona. I didn't go to doctor and was positive all the time. After 1 or 2 day; It wall all okay. Switzerland does not test people with mild symptoms my 84 mother in law contracted it; more than 3 weeks ago.  was asympotomatic and is well Nope Husband's co-worker had it; had mild symptoms for five days my friend's grandma who had coronavirus managed to survive Many; many people have shown to be asymptomatic; so no one can really; truly know if they have the virus; which is scary. affects the psychological of people My girlfriend works at a bar; so we think she might have contracted COVID-19 there. We did not have any symptoms though; so it is only a guess. My last survey (Risk attitudes; risk management behaviors; social perception; and cooperation under disease threat ???????? 6.2) got timed-out; but I have finished it so please review it; I have written the same thing about me and my girlfriend there. No Nothing. I had what started like a cold which developed suddenly into high temperature and chills. Followed by extremely bad headache and tiredness. Then developed a tight chest and cough Unsure about me as I was abroad in America before it was initially announced there In case there is even a remote chance of being affected by the virus I find it very important to avoid get in contact with people in person. The covid 19 is a serious problem My member of my family who doesn't live with me believes she had COVID-19; though was not tested for it; and has; since her recovery; experienced what seems very much to be COVID toe. I don't think covid will effect much my personal health About myself? Not really. Fingers crossed; no one I know has had it so far. I'm certain it's only a matter of time though. I know a friend who contacted covid; but wasn't tested positive and I didn't have contact with him for almost a year I had some breathing difficulties on that week; no other symptoms. Barely went out and was very careful tho; so I think it's unlikely it was the virus stay alert I got small fever 5 days after being in the subway I didn't contract neither someone I know My cousin who had COVID-19 is recovering but it has resulted in a problem with his heart and ME. He is awaiting a heart scan at the moment It is a very scary thought The person I know has had both of their lungs collapse due to COVID The person who I know; has fully recovered since then No One of my  partners had coronavirus I know noone with the virus My friend got sick because her mother works at a hospital. luckily for me I prepared the things I need before it all blew up and I didn't spent huge amounts of money for masks no The person I know lives in the Toronto area where there have been many cases. I live in a rural area and so far; no one in the small town (5000 people) by where I live has contracted it. not really; to be honest - if I get it; I get it. They don't give tests for their families A friend in the States died from it Most cases of Covid-19 are really mild and the best way to treat them is to stay at home and rest with some medication. Stay isolated. No one I know has COVID-19 Obey the distancing rules; do not hoard essential cleaning necessities symptoms like a really bad cold A friend of my mother caught it; probably from the care home she manages. Not at this time Once we knew of someone getting the virus; it seemed to change the perspective and became more important Unfortunetly; I have nothing interesting to share. Stay Strong; it's going to pass At some point we would need to be tested to know if we have contracted the disease No It is very surprisig to me that at this point of the pandemic; i do not know anyone who has contracted COVID-19 Personally I do not believe I have had COVID-19 as I have been careful with my health; but at the same time since many people can be asymptomatic it is theoretically possible. But again I have had no indications to thing I have been infected i dont know anybody I am at risk as I have an underlying health condition I had somethign with very similar symptoms in December 2019 but as this was before it was circulating I suspect that it was somethign else.  I've not been tested for antobodies so I don't know. My friend's test got positive; she is in Abu Dhabi as a nurse; because her company basically only cares about money crammed them in one service car; didn't tell the other nurses thier driver got infected they had to be in that car 2 times a daily because they wanted to save money... I would like them to stay home to stop the spread of the virus It seems that the strength of the virus is different from people to people The person that has COVID-19 was in the front-line of the COVID combat working at the Hospital at Lisbon. I am quite sure I got it; but I did not have any strong symptoms so I did not even notice My veterinarian's father passed away from the virus. My parents are healthcare workers. My father still sees patients. I worry about them contracting it. They are in a high-risk age group. I am from a small town yet I know a lot of people which is nerve racking. Many of the people I know showed symptoms of the virus but they have not been tested. had mild symptoms; it lasts many days No. I'm on the east coast; but my cousin on the west coast said she had it; and my sister in Edmonton said she had a really bad flu in February; but she was tested a month ago and it was negative. Otherwise; I was raised by post ww2 parents (they were born before and after ww2) on a farm; and having a well stocked pantry is just something normal to me. Stay at home! My partner is a doctor working in an hospital that has treated many COVID patients; which increases the likelihood that we both conract COVID Kept safe from the pandemic and did not suffer any losses thankfully My uncle; who contracted covid-19; unfortunately passed away no People need to start being more responsible for themselves and others Be strong My mum's closest friend had the virus bu she followed guidelines by isolating for 14 days and helping her immune system by taking meds and she recovered Luckily I still haven't heard of anyone I know contracting it It's fast and deadly; what can seem as a common cold with little to no symptoms can kill an elderly person overnight. I was un tested but am sure i have had it as was  very poorly ",,,,,,,

ActivityChanges,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nothing changed; I've always exercised alone and in solitary from other people so COVID19 changed nothing Was less when in quarantine it is getting to normal become much less active; stay home more; no swimming no no I stopped going our regularly for about 3 months which completely stopped any physical activity I had before (walking) I am moving less as still working from home so no waking to work; I have put on weight. We have been going running though which we never did before. No change i am doing much less exercise since the pandemic and anything that i do i am only doing very locally ie.. walking around the road walking i used to swim vigorously three times a week in a public pool i was doing more exercise before the pandemic e.g. gym and alot more walking and jogging More alone exercise I walk less; I workout in my home less No changes I am less active; as I have been shielding; and have therefore been staying in my home. I did not have any physcial activity; but my social interactions are changed because of social distancing rules. It is really hard to be separated from each other by wearing masks and leaving distances. it is the same I used to play pick-up basketball at least once a week with a group of guys from our church. Haven't been able to do that. Also; I would take my kids and go run drills but I no longer have access to the gym due to Covid restrictions. Use an exercise bike at home near daily instead of going to the gym 2~ times a week. Walk less I used to take a 2-5 hr walk to the city center 2 times a week alone; I do that maybe once a week now and it's shorter (2 hrs max). GOT WORSE None I walk a bit more and I go with a friend or two sometimes. I walk everyday for long periods before i used to go to the gym but now I discovered youtube channels with very good training videos and I'm doing that My pilates classes have stopped for the summer; but will resume again at the end of August (twice-weekly).  I also like to go cycling on a daily basis but this has stopped; not because of covid; but because of the weather (temperatures above 40 degrees centigrade daily in July and August).  So while my activity patterns have changed; it is due to the weather rather than due to the pandemic. I have less mild exercise; for shorter periods of time. I have more moderate exercise; to reduce my time spent in public transport by cycling instead. I exercise more inside now. No change I get out more for free I rarely engage in physical activities; but the ones I did were inaccessible for me due to quarantine. That???s why I hardly ever exercised during the pandemic. The walks were usually shorter and less tiring; I walked alone. 30 hago ejercicio mas a menudo;sobre todo en cas A litle Don't exercise outside at all A lot less active as I am not volunteering or going out walking or shopping with friends I go out less so I don't do as much physical work. changed for way less than usual; especially since most exercise was long walks I used to go to the gym twice a week doing weights; and take long walks in the neighborhood everyday Have been walking more often but have not taken up any new type of activity They changed a lot; now i have to excercise at home and alone; before covid i could go jogging outside with my partner and run in the park; i had also more time to spend for it; at home is different; you need to do more static activities Well; I've added some new routines and activities; and I keep on with the usual ones; so I exercise more now. I was working out at the university's gym as part of physical education ""classes"" once a week; but since the university has closed down due to the pandemic I have completely stopped working out. Most things are the same. I have started strength training Both my dance and barre classes have been cancelled. I find it extremely hard to exercise at home as my son is with me and I also lack motivation. I exercise a lot more since the all this started. Actually; I don't how I'm going to handle times to exercise when I go back to work. They have not changed Since I work from home I have more time to dedicate to physical activities but I do not go much to the gym; I rather perform activities outdoor or at home Walking daily as gym is closed Doing more exercise indoors rather than outdoor training pretty much the same My activity patterns have not changed because I have always exercised at home. They haven't changed much; I still have the same opportunities to exercise and use them the same amount. 7 days per week: hard cycling 1 hr outdoors group; mid exercise gym indoors alone and 1 hr yoga alone. A lot; working out at home its not the same as the gym. I am much less active now. I work out less frequently and for less duration. However; I have increased my mild exercise and walk every day. Pre-covid I participated in a lot of group exercise including bootcamps; gym classes; swimming and running with friends; squash with friends. All of this has now stopped I used to walk or play badminton with my friends outside but now we don't due to lockdown and social distancing. Now i rarely exercise but when i do i exercise alone by looking at tabata videos far more activity at home for longer; started running; more exercycling; and took up strength exercises again I spend more time outdoors. I run more in the fresh air; more walks.. I try to do light exercises in the morning so as not to gain weight. Sometimes I play football with friends; now is the perfect time for that Due to the quarantine the gym was closed; so I had to exercise on my own at home; and I did not have the necessary knowledge; so I did not train as often and as hard as I used to. I cant go to the gym at all and uni has closed so I dont really go anywhere by bike nor do I exercise like I used to. All the exercise I do is jogging alone at night in the countryside; not far from my home; where I hardly meet any people. It hasn't changed a bit compared to my life before pandemic. Frequency changed because it is summer now; so I do jogging more often. No. slightly less active social activity has slightly decreased. Physical activity remains unchanged. Walking more frequently and longer on weekends and more brisk walking Lessed only slightly do to depression and not being able to leave house as often my life changed for the better due to the quarantine starting to teach me more while exercising; I usually do some runs with medium intensity n.a When we were in lockdown i engaged in physical activity every day for at least half an hour; i did it with my sister and it was moderate exercise. Before the pandemic i sometimes went running by myself I didn't do much regular exercise before the pandemic either; but now have even less time; with my preschooler taking classes at home and now during his vacation. I exercise more often compared before Covid time; either alone or with others. I do yoga for a longer period of time I'm not really doing any excercise; before the pandemic; i used to walk a lot for all my daily needs; but after the pandemic i haven't been doing much excercise. Tried to do more at home I am doing more exercise in general. Before Covid I didnt do any but now i workout 5 times a week in my house. I used to attend the gym around 3 times a week and also walked a lot more More things to do and less time to do them i do the same activities but most of them i'm doing it alone. No gym etc. My patterns didnt change at all I have taken up running 3 times a week; It is an intensive run and I generally run 3-5km 3 times a weekI walk places much more frequently so as to use my car less and spend time with my children on walks. I stopped going to the gym; but I already had a setup at home and started using it more. For a while I had to exercise alone; but lately I have a cousin trying to lose weight and he started working out with me. Most days I work out alone; with the same intensity I used to work out with at the gym; but when he works out with me it's more intense than in the pre-CoVid-19 days. they haven't changed; the only change is the active wear of a facemask no Now my activities are always outside My physical activities have not changed because I rarely engage in physical activity Less frequent Much less expertise of all types I don't exercise nor go the gym they havent changed. ive tried to make them the same I wasn't able to go to badminton with my father for 3 months because of covid; but now we are going to badminton once a week again. more gym at home; more running outside Changed a lot; specially the outdoor activities; i think more than 50% no it hasn't changed I'm excercising at home now (before in the gym) and alone; the frequency and intensity haven't changed. yes no dancing in festivals; not going out everyday to work More time to do longer periods of exercise but some are less intense as I have no gym or gym classes at set times Before the pandemic I used to travel to the university; typically; I walked around 25 minutes in that trip. Obviously during the pendemic I've changed my activity and I noticed so I decided to change my mild exercise to a moderate; so I can compensate the fact that I've been staying at home. I can't go outside and walk on the boulevard or go and visit a friend; do some cardio with them and even visiting the rest of my family is not possible; so it's way less exercise They have become more intense Before Coivd I worked out more intense Nothing changed Before pandemic I was training in the gym and after it I was training at home and running outside. It changed completely i sued to have a schedule with what i would do every day and now i dont have one and i dont do exercise as often as i normally do I work out more at home; all alone Much more physically active. Used to be sedentary and this is no longer the case. I don't go to the gym anymore because i've learned to do everything at home or outside I prefer to work out on my own now and not with friends. My workouts are less intense cause I lack the motivation More cardio outside; higher intensity I used to go more often to the public swimming pool and sometimes I stay for less time because there are people waiting. I am less active. Not going to events or restaurants. More group activities before the pandemic - a lot of walking alone or with just one friend now Since I'm not allowed to do any strenuous excercise any more (I have to keep my blood pressure normal;otherwise I lose sight completely); I do only gardening; occasional walking and Tibetan hormonal gymnastics. I started gardening later than previously (end of April); since I was scared I get Covid-19 in the bus. But I spend longer days in the garden; because I travel when the buses are not so crowded - the first departure in the morning (6.28 instead of 9.20) and the last one back to town (23.00 instead of I'm doing more exercises at home alone now rather than at gym I started doing more yoga at home instead of going for walks. not changed It hasnt I started to exercise more at home; I resigned from my gym membership (gyms are opened here; but I'm too scared to come back because of covid); I walk instead of using public transport They have been greatly diminished in every aspect great effort (gym workout) exercise 4-5 times a week 1-1;5 hour each session No changes my activity used to be outside and in the gym; between 1-3 hours 4 times a week; now it's still alone; but inside; between 1-3 hours about 4-3 times a week and high intensity as before Yes Nothing changed don't go to the gym anymore; spend a lot more time walking outside. Don't do any intense exercise; more mild like fast walking and nothing too hard. Yes it change. They are longer and more intesity used to play soccer a lot. After pandemic it has been vey rare I used to attend the gym at least twice a week; along with walking around my neighbourhood. I have stopped going to the gym; continue to work out alone; and workout for less time and less often; and I don't do hard exercises as much. Become less frequent My gym & yoga studio have reopened; but I'm hesitant to go there since they're public places. It's harder to motivate myself to exercise when I'm at home. I also work from home now so I don't walk places or go outside as much as I used to. Working out at home with resistance bands instead of at a gym with weights. Always alone at home; intensity is a bit less but the frequency and duration are about the same as previous. No change; I exercise at home. I stopped going to swimming pool Exercised in a group outside quite often and it usually took 1.5 hours per class. Do all my workouts from home instead of at the gym and I do them alone rather than with friends. I've begun to bike and run more outside to enjoy the weather and find things to do. I've done more exercise alone than in a group.The constant use of a face mask was a challenge at first but it is something that you can grow into I used to go for easy walks outside on my own. I stopped doing them in March due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the de-confinment began in my country during the summer months and it's too hot to exercise outdoors. I am significantly less active now Outside in a group. Exercises feel hard because of worse endurance I used to go to the gym; now I lift at home but do it less than before and not with the same intensity. Less Before covid i didnt make any exercises. Now i use to follow some youtube videos to workout in my home. Additionaly i use to run in my treadmille. Completely. I had a break from physical activity after I got pregnant and had a child; but now my daughter is over 4 and I've finally got back to regular exercises and started running (for the first time in my life!) I no longer go to the gym and don't leave my house much at present I used to walk outside for hours before the pandemic. I stopped group actibities (yoga) and signigficantly reduced other activities (walking) No I have to go to the gym in specific hours now and only with appointment; so it is a little bit uncomfortable for me since i do not have much free time available at the moment. I also have to wear masks and gloves all the time in my workplace and in the supermarket; which although is a necessity; it can be quite bothersome during summertime. They have not changed a lot; I used to walk from home to college everyday for about 30 minutes; but now I try to do more exercise (full bodyweight) about 2 times a week for half an hour.. I used to go to the gym 3 days per week and workout for an hour and a half. Now I work out at home 6 days per week and it's much more intense. Of course in the gym I was surrounded by other people (some are friends of mine) and at home I work out alone. I use the public transport less often; instead I walk towards my destination sometimes. I also prefer going for walks with friends than spending time in caf??s. Other than that; it's the same. I was going to the gym prior to covid but not now. I will be starting again I've stopped bicycling and playing football; so actually I am doing almost nothing I was a couch potato before covid19. I have now made an effort to go outside walking twice a week and built this into my routine Yes it has. I stopped exercising for a while; but now I started up again; but I spend less time doing it. I used to walk to work everyday (an hour a day) and I dont do that anymore It changed; I occasionally worked out at the building's gym. Now; I work out 3 times a week at home using youtube. Well; my job was 10 to 12 hour shifts on my feet all day; by the end of the day I had been running from one assignment to the next so much that I was exhausted. I often went straight to bed for a nap when I got home. My home activity was to sit and read. Now without a job; at first I read all day. Now I am working on a home renovation project (nearly done) and a garden plot. Hanging drywall and sanding down seams has been my main exercise the last 2 months or so. 0 They haven???t Nothing change I used to go jogging and to the gym; now i lift weights at home. It hasn't changed much. Well; I haven't been able to go to a gym for sometime; so I'm limited mostly to cardio type exercise rather than strength training. Less social contact At home; alone. Various exercises. I never exercised regularly; but I walked few kilometers a day to get to university and back; sometimes twice a day. Now I rarely leave home (but I have holidays now; so I most likely wouldn't go out much even if there was no pandemic; it refers to time between March and June then) They haven't really changed because I really didn't have time to go somewhere and exercise Only change is missing out on team sports very They have not changed Now I only walk alone. I can't go to the gym I am often walking and jogging alone before and after working from home - whereas before; I would've ran in the gym and swam in the local pool. outside; walking; alone; every time I needed to go out to do something; 1 or 2 hours; easy. My activity takes place at home now; except for walks I take outside; and I do it more rarely Due to having covid 19 and then pneumonia my activity has decreased as I have been unable to do even minimal activity. I  used to go to the gym with friends; now I exercise at home with next to no equipment. I also don't exercise as much or as intensively as I used to; every day No Moderately I go to the gym way less; and I feel more heavy I literally stopped doing everything that would make me sweat i used to take walks with friends and family and now i don't do that no changes was not very active now I exercise more muscle exercises. not at all Since COVID 19; I have started to do home workouts targeting abs and legs 5 days a week for 25 minutes a day. It is moderately hard but it is not exhausting. Before the pandemic I used to walk a lot and with company alongside; but now I don't really take long walks at all. more activity at home Yes Mostly the same due to my line of work Yes; before the pandemic i used to go to the gym; but i now i train at home with my dumbbells. i used to walk more before covid; alone or in a group but i'd waalk a lot before. not so much now Not changed I choose to stay at home and do nothing more often doing more exercise at home by myself compared before and doing more relaxing type of exercise more than the serious one I'm no longer allowed to train contact sports; which was my favourite sport. The gym reopened about a month ago so I'm back to lifting weights but have to go immediately after work or early in the morning to avoid other people as there's a cap to how many people are allowed in the gym at once. The pattern didn't change I am less active overall; although I still do mild exercies(Mostly stretching every few hours); it is definetly less than when I felt I could go outside safely. Due pandemic gym I attended is closed. Also outdoor gym in town I used when had a walk is closed. Lockdown distracted my activity patterns. I am less active - indoors more and; due to working from home; I am not walking during lunchtime & part of the commutes. The intensity of the activities have changed the most as I had to adjust to exercise in my studio apartment. I do not own gym equipment; so I've made my own weights out of household materials and mainly used whatever I could around the house. Stretching and other mild activities have not changed so much; though; and I have not stopped cycling and jogging; which is my main form of exercise. make the same amount of exercice The activity has not changed much except there are less people allowed in the center now; so there are fewer people in the classes The overall intensity of exercises has increased; but the frequency has decreased. Before corona there were more opportunities to be active in the everyday life I keep doing the same routines. I used to work out 6 days a week now I barely move from my chair. we have a ring fit we use twice a week that quite active I always worked out from home; sometimes go out for a walk but always by myself and exercises were somehow intense; but since the pandemic started my motivation went down; regarding exercise and rarely do now. No Not at all; I am still not working out The major change is happened with gym as before i go to gym regularly and without any hesitation but now i am reluctant to go there and i see everyone with suspected eyes. I stopped going to the gym I started spending more time outdoors doing exercise 0 i dont go to the gym anymore Much less active Its more than before I now exercise alone and when in the gym I wear a mask and do not interact with other people 3 Much less exercise than before the pandemic cannot go out so dont exercise Before the Covid-19 hit I used to routinely walk to my university every day and it was a part of my weekly exercise but even since then I've been staying home more and not doing much. Lately since the situation in my place of residence is getting under control I slowly began to take longer walks on my own but I'm not as motivated as I was before. My walks usually took about 2 hours in total and I'm a type of person who is always fast walking. I used to walk alone and I'm still doing it this way. It didn't changed not at all; trained in my backyard I was doing Pilates at home by myself, but now I haven't been doing it because pregnancy makes it hard for me to work out. I used to use the gym and swimming pool but cannot now. It means that the intensity of my exercise now is much lower. I have a treadmill at my house; use about 3 times a week for about 30 minutes at a time. just normal walking for the most part. now i do sport outside and not at home; with more people around me I used to go to the gym in group with my friends twice a week; but now I cant. not big change I became more sedentary. I spend almost all my time at home doing nothing I was more active - i walked more and did sport at school. now I workout No longer go to the gym for hr-long sessions 2/3 times a week; no longer play competitive table tennis for two hours two evenings a week. No longer have two 20 minute walks from station to work one day a fortnight. It has drastically changed for the worse; I used to go to the pool (which are all closed now) 3x a week; and occasionally to the gym; which I also dropped out of and is a lot harder to get back to going The only real difference is I have more free time and so can exercise more regularly than before. I'm working out at home; not gym as i usually did I'm leaving the house a lot less now; no school run; no meeting friends become less active No longer commuting so not cycling as much. More dog walking. Once a week kickboxing stayed the same only went online - only very hard exercise I go out less in general i rarely ever exercise; and when i do it is alone; whilst before the pandemic i went to the gym and partook group activities such as swimming and muay thai keeps the same I used to go to the gym. Now I either run outside or do a circuit at home. I used to sometimes work out with weights; but I don't that anymore because I don't own any; and I currently don't go to the gym. I didn???t use to do much exercise. That being said; I used to walk a lot more and I now stay much more time at home sitting. Used to cycle 40-45 min (10-14 miles depending on route) to work and back 5 days per week Used to run 3 times/week for 1 hour and stopped since the pandemic Became less frequent During lockdown I was able to workout when I wanted and for as long as I wanted. I have been less lethargic because I wasn???t working out first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. My intensity was much higher as my body had the energy to do so. i used to go to gym to group classes; but now I exercise alone at home and more frequent Never exercised due to disability My activity patterns didnt change. Physical activity outdoors; alone; 5 days per week with the duration of 45minutes each. The intesity is strenous exercise Not changef no My activity patterns have not changed at all. They didn't change at all. Not much has changed; I always exercise alone at home; I do not like the gym I am working out alone and its not motivating. Its the same Trying to work out at home; a lot harder to be motivated and don't feel as though I am working as hard; often or as long. no change They haven't changed it didn't change currently i'm not working out; i used to have pe lessons/gym at school but i graduated in may I was going to the gym but now i???m scared to go It's easier to find the time to exercise outside; but it's not convenient/safe. I increased the intensity; but not necessarily the frequency it has changed very much ; before the pandemic i used to go to the gym everyday and sit with a group of friends almost every other week. now after the pandemic most gyms keep closing and opening i've lost the will to go to the gym and we rarely sit down as a group and just have fun. basically have not changed I???ve started regularly working out according to a schedule to make the best use of my time in quarantine I work out a lot less Well i skate; but when i do i prefer being alone and sometimes its more intense and sometimes less it totally depends on my mood Before covid i was going to the gym and more social life. And to get to some places i had to walk; therefore; i was spending less time sitting and more time walking they have changed very positively Yes I haven't had access to the things I used to; hence having less options and getting rid of old patterns. i became more active I used to go to the gym twice a week for 1h30. Now I barely do anything sport related yoga for 15-20 minutes day 4 time a weeks and Hiking - 40 minutes - 3 times a week My activity pattern has changed drastically; I am now less motivated to do any work outs as I do not have GYM equipment's  with me to challenge me etc. NO Do everything from home now instead of the gym I definitely became more active. It was hard for me to do a workout on a regular basis but during the quarantine it became easier to do. I'm doing my workout at home but also bicycling outside. I used to go to the gym; but now i just stay at home I used to go to uni by foot and riding the subway and then being with my ex partner and walk a lot too. I usually walked outside for more than 2 hours a day Working from home I have more time to exercise I think I've exercised more than before the pandemic Much more at home; alone; sometimes even more time than before; and more intense they done alome now rather than in groups pre-covid; so it is harder Not by much but I do exercise more. I've been exercising at home for a while; long before pandemic. Working from home meant that I cannot usually do my lunch hour walks but I compensate by doing extra at home now. I also cycle more at the moment and became more confident in road cycling during lockdown as the streets were empty. Not really; nothing really changed in my activity patterns; the difference is that now; i just avoid even more going outside Yes; it changes more walking and discovering local trails wasn't doing almost any exercise before covid; now I do bodyboard some times; mostly because its summer I have been working out only from home. I ordered some equipment online and am having to push myself harder in order to compensate for the lack of general activity I used to get during day to day life i.e. walking and travelling during the day. I have also been varying my workouts and have been more creative in coming up with ways to exercise. My activity patterns haven't changed. a little more exercise at home moderate intensity/low impact + weights i walk a lot to work;  the dogs   daily; because of the pandemic it was less walking ;  were not going to work; and my daughter  walked the dogs to;  now am walking to walk ; but am a bit slower ;  and my daughter is still helping with walking dogs ;  so that is still less I do less activities; I dont Walk; I used to Walk a lot I go out less so I do no exercise at all. I was a ""fast walker"" before I've always avoided exercising indoors in gyms. I've always run early in the morning when it's cooler so nothings has changed They haven't changed Didn't change at all. I only jog and I avoided the crowdy timeslots even before COVID. I walked every day and now that doesn't happen I used to go to the gym almost everyday; now I basically only do cycling two or three times a week. I am no longer taking part in exercise classes (which used to be my main form of exercise) as the facilities are not open to the public. I have managed at least 1 jog per week; and we do lots of walking with the kids and dog at the weekend. I have also tried to do 2 hours per week on the exercise bike; although struggle for motivation when I'm not in a class. I would class my level of activity to have dropped moderately since lockdown. I have put on 1.5 stone since March 2020. They havent changed Overall; I think I've been doing more road cycling (that is cycling outside; in the countryside) on my own. I don??????????t have to walk to uni anymore. So I stopped walking at least 1h every day No change no changes I am not going to the gym during the shutdown but I have made myself a home gym.  I am walking; jogging and biking more on a consistent basis and working out at home during the shutdown.  I did not have the time to execersise this much before.  I am not playing basketball and baseball hardly at all now because I do not want to be in groups of people. I would usually walk to work or walk to smaller shops.  Now I work from home and drive to do a big once weekly shop More active because I don't need to walk in office any more I havent gone to a gym in months; now limited to at home workouts and walking. I experienced no changes not hard Hasn't changed at all They haven't because I do my activities solo There has not been much change. nothing is changed Since the pandemic I have gone from working in the office to working from home; and I no longer take my lunchtime walks as a result of this. no changes I don't go to the gym now Not much; because I don't like sports and I'm not a sports person. Even before the covid; I limited myself every now and then to do some exercise at home; nothing more. Now I workout at home or outside (previously I used to go to the gym); I workout alone as before; the activities; frequency; duration and intensity is the same as before It hasn't changed at all not really Apart from now always exercising on my own rather than with a partner or in a group my activity patterns have changed very little no change about the same Since the pandemic I have been more active and engaged in more exercise; but I also stopped going to the gym. I do ""harder"" workout but I feel less tired Haven't really changed at all. stay in more ; eat more I am disabled and the large part of my exercise routine was in the pool sadly I haven't been able to do this at all Exercise more i would do exercise with friends a lot more often and would go to the gym more often Workouts at home 7 I exercise outside or in my room instead of the gym no i usually exercised at home alone and did it at the same rate i do now; only now it's summer so i don't like to sweat Dog walks twice a day. My son now has my dog at home It has changed a lot. We go on more walks; bike rides and am outside more. We walk the dogs a couple times a day and ride our bikes at least a few times a week. It??????????s not really hard exercise. I'm doing less sports now outside the home (mid; moderate; strenuous) but increased the amount of walking I am doing Nothing changed at all reduced physical activity due to the risk of infection Before I only rode bicycle; now I have a gym membership and I go 2-3 times a week. When I was in the gym before; I didn't have a problem with multiple people being in the wardarobe; but now it feels like a chamber. Because everyone sweats in the gym; and the showers are closed off; this only worsens the situation. I don't go for as many walks Hiking a lot As I am working from home and not having to travel to work; I have more free time at the end of the day to workout and go for a run. Before COVID; it was a struggle to find time to exercise. no change None They have not changed I started cycling and went to the gym I used to go to the gym sometimes or do some group workouts with my friends almost every day of the week. I was trying to get back to swimming before the pandemic. Nowadays; I feel very sedentary and I don??????????t get enough exercise to spent all my energy; therefore I can??????????t sleep that well. I started some online challenges and tried yoga and I cannot seem to stick to anything. I do some power walks in nature. I do a lot less exercise now i ran on a treadmill the same before covid and during covid It didn't. less often and less social I have increased my strenuous activity levels and worked out primarily at home. I have increased my amounts of outdoor walks as well. They did not changed at all Less frequent at-home exercises I do it less often and it is not as intense I don't do regular exercise; I only walk from time to time and with COVID-19 I started doing it less often. When cycling I make sure that I know all the people and make sure that they are not infected I've been more aware of where I do these activities. A lot I walk a little bit less I was going to the gym 6 times per week. I lifted heavy weights and did some cardio. I had a bit fat but i was strong. Now i am ddemotivated and fat. It's changed - now I'm practicing alone; I'm trying to continue my activity but now  I'm doing it with my familymore often; I'm practicing shorter now i can afford just a walk in a park I've gone for longer walks by myself because I've been working from home. I've still worked out at home consistently during this pandemic Before covid I only walked to the bus station for work; now I go to work by bycicle 2 times a week. Reduced social activity Before the pandemic I used to go to the gym monday to friday every day; since it started I havent been to the gym and dont exercise at home at all. They havent because I have Fibromyalgia. I never did a lot of exercise but; before the pandemic; I would walk a lot since I had to go my university to attend classes and I don't have a driver's license. After covid all my classes were suspended and we started to only have them online so I became a lot less active and spend most of my days at home working on my computer. I wasn't working out too often before covid; I was doing some cycling; but it wasn't very intense. I did a lot more before no change I have been at work less so I have been less active as when I am at work I walk and move around a lot. Before COVID I attended the gym once a week to do zumba but I do this class online now. no changes I have been less active I am enjoying exercising more at home with the Joe Wickes videos on You Tube more often doing physical activities at home but much less social activity; friends visiting; not going to casino and bars withour terrase i don't go to gym anymore. I've restarted going to the pool Not changed Due to coronavirus i'm not able to got to the gym so I have to exercise at home. I am trying to work out using a face mask which may be a problem during aerobic exercise; apart from that mostly the same. no I used to go to many places walking or cycling to see friends or to go to university or to work; now I do not anymore at first my physical activity ceased almost entirely;  until I committed to following online exercise videos daily (kickboxing; dance);  but these two weeks I've lost that because I have a huge exam and sadly I sit 24/7 I used to train at the gym 2 times a week usually Not being able to go to the gym; going for long walks less often. Fairly similar Before the pandemic I had been regularly visiting a swimming pool; where I participated in both group classes and solo swimming. The swimming pool is still closed. Now I only do some walking and hiking.. Since COVID-19; I've started to work out regularly. I've had to move my work outs from the gym to my home but I have some equipment at home as well. I've also started using online work outs via instagram and youtube. Work outs range from 30 mins to 50 mins depending on the activity. I hardly do any exercise now. running 30m; 2 days a week; alone I never used to exercise before covid; however with my free time i decided to get fit and am enjoying the changes; i enjoy working out alone as i dont feel self conscious; I am currently doing 6 days a week for 40-45 minutes I canceled my gym subscription and spend my time mostly at home; obtained a hometrainer from a thriftshop in order to continue working out regularly. I work out less often and if I do; I do it in a solitary setting. No. I've been going out for a walk a little less frequently than before I have stopped working out. As I have more spare time I now do a 2 mile wake every evening.  I am also using the spare time to carry out some projects which I have not had time to do before the pandemic.  This involves quite a lot of physical activity such as mixing cement; handling 66lb bags of materials; building and cutting sandstone; digging foundations etc. Before covid-19; I had a gym routine I followed. During my contriy's lockdown (and after) I stop attending the gym and tried working out (less) at home Not changed much I wasn't excersising before covid-19 and im not excercising now also In the current period; because of we haven't lockdown; my activity is the same as before the COVID-19 My activity patterns have changed a lot. 2 My activity settings are mostly indoors or within my neighbourhood and typically in a solitary context rather than group context. I can only do solo activities like walking; dancing; yoga etc. and the intensity of the activities are less intense than before. I can't play volleyball at my college. My PE lessons are canceled. So I have to go play outside with my friends. they haven't changed More time to excercise I walk everyday outside with my husband and my dog. (long walks) not at all I used to walk to work daily now I walk for leisure when I can There is less exercise. I can not go to the swimming pool or join team sports. But i participate in more inividual sports. i do not walk so often It is the same; a lot of gardening; DIY jobs around the house and walks for leisure I tend to stay home more and work out at home more and make more effort whilst being home yes i just do what i did before Before I went to gym 2-3 times a week; now I don't cause I wouldn't feel safe there Nothing change I used to go to the gym with a group of 10 people in a room; two times a week. It has completely changed after COVID-19; and I'm not planning on returning yet. Doing 30 mins exercise every day on my own no change I exercise at home and outside more often no change Not much has changed I am doing more work outs from home and more streetvrunning than before. Similar intensity to pre lockdown for about thirty mins per day. I used to do group dance classes several times a week but now I follow YouTube fitness videos with another person at home A lot. I'm more active decrease a little less walking less going to the gym I am walking every day ( non stop ) for more then 1 hour athen doing some work around the house I'm doing more exercises at home; on my own. My trainings are longer but less intense. no change not changed At the beginning of lockdown I did a lot of online workouts - Joe Wicks and Yoga as well as running.  Now i have stopped the online classes and just do the running.  I am recovering from a torn calf so am only doing it every other day and combining it with walking over about 5k More cardio and less strength since COVID I??????????ve been more active I used to go for long walks with one of my friends before the pandemic; which I no longer do. Now I do yoga at home; go for walks; and jog alone (the only thing that has changed is going for walks alone vs. with someone) I noticed that the route selection for my daily run is made intuitively; to avoid the crowds. Before the pandemic; I did a lot of outdoor sports: I went to the swimming pool; to the gym; quite often went on bike trips out of town or just walked. Usually these were lonely activities; nothing has changed in this respect. Now; for a long lockdown period; I've lost shape; mainly doing exercises at home - aerobics; yoga. I don't feel like going to the gym or swimming pool for fear of getting infected. During coronavirus; my physical activity is definitely less frequent and shorter; and also less intense. Don't exercise.  Have spent more time on housework and gardening activities than pre-pandemic however. I worked out less during the lockdown. Also less intense. Started working out alone in home; and sometimes running in the streets or the beach Before I worked out only in school (PE lessons); now I workout at home or inside more frequently (4 times a week) I meet my friends less often.Everything else the same I walk around less but concentrate on physical exercise more. I can't/won't go to the gym; so I'm doing my strength training at home which is less intense. I'm keeping my cardio training as intense because not having a gym doesn't affect that kind of exercise too much. My frequency of training hasn't changed I am less active now because my intensity of training has diminished. they have increased Yes I exercise more often than before pandemic 0 I stopped going to the gym and started working out at home; more running and playing sports Stopped going to the gym Before at least I went out for a walk every day; now it is null More hard physical work and activity I used to walk much; much more before the pandemic. Now I don't walk that much. Almost no activity since lockdown. I have had a weight gain ???????????? skate more at home I'm less inclined to go to places with other people. For example hiking trails; swimming ponds; so since there's less variation I'm less motivated to do something. Didnt change It pretty much hasn't changed I started doing individual exercises like yoga and going for runs; which I didn't before but I still play basketball with a few friends around twice per week; similar to before. i exercise at home every morning now; when before I wouldn't have had the time to exercise at all They haven't changed much besides the time of day when I exercise; I used to do it early in the morning; now I do it throughout the day I started to work out at home; sometimes; but it is not hard exercises; just some practical and quick exercises. I think I enjoy more my free time and now I started to enjoy more the sun; I already went to the beach. However; I have some afraid to catch the virus... I run with a friend; but now after covid we are more aware of our surrounding and try to actively avoid paths where there are lots of people . Duration and frequency as well as intensity are the same as before I did more night walks since COVID Ive gone from going to the gym To doing home workouts and made do with minimal equipment My physical activity was the Same. I train in home befoure and now. Overall lesser activity I've been doing workouts at home for at least 20-40 minutes per day; and they're intensive i decided to take care of my immunity and I started to exercice at home by watching dvd with trenings I do these exercises 5 days a week about 35-45 minutes or longer (intervals; cardio; aerobics). Before pandemic I did'nt do it. I also walk for a walk with my dog about 1 hour every day and I did it before pandemic. Before pandemic I liked swimming very much but during the pandemic swimming-pools were closed. 7 I spend more time on my bicycle; I would be swimming around this time but most of swimming pools that I was going to are closed now; I exercise alone (before the covid and now during the covid); the frequency of activities (cycling) got more often and is longer. Intensity is the same as before. more outside Have been exercising at home i bought a bike a ride a lot outside for about 1-2 hours a day i go outside for walks more dancing at home; 45mins per day; mild intensity I didn't do any physical activity before Covid-19 and that hasn't changed. I used to go to the gym with other people; now I only exercise at home alone and usually for a short time (30 minutes) so it's not really intense. less activity for sure cause of the quarantine and safe measures they didin't change it's worse less walking more driving; no gym MORE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ALONE All of my exercises have been from home and alone and have been of higher intensity and more comfort Before the pandemic; I was trying to get outside and walk more; but everything kind of just made me nervous to go out if others were going to be in the same space as me. Everything is the same - my main physical activity are long; fast walks (either alone or with my girlfriend; depending on whether or not she has time to do it) and I have been doing them both before and during pandemic. all home based rather than gym based; i have tried new styles of exercise at home that are both gentler and more intense Not a huge amount has changed; I would say that I go on more leisurely walks; though; My life is currently much slower as I am used to being busy with school runs etc which isn??????????t happening right now. When children go back to school I expect I will be a lot more active again I would visit the gym three times a week and work up a sweat every time. I would also do muscle workouts. I would on average spend an hour at the gym during these sessions and would have to goal to burn 500 calories by myself My physical activity is much more organised; regular and conscious than before. Before I used to walk to get to the places I wanted. Now I don't feel the need to leave my home because I do everything online No gym and no football; so; i lost mass and resistance I miss roller blading; which is intense exercise for me. But there are too many people outside at most any given time on the sidewalks that I forgo this activity. Went from going to the gym in a group to at home alone I exercise less regularly; and the other aspects (activity; intensity or setting) have not changed I had some more time free with the pandemic; that i used to exercise Slightly increased Theoretically; nothing has changed with regard to where I did the exercises. I am and I was active at home; only during the first weeks of the pandemic I stopped riding my bike. It's more difficult to find places. Some gyms just reopened with a booking fashion. I'm currently going to a park to avoid people. I used to power walk to and from work each day which took over an hour so this was my main form of exercise. Now I am a lot more sedentary and have less desire to go outside so I am moving around a lot less and have less desire to exercise even though it makes me feel better. I either biked to&from work or took a taxi to work and took a bus & walked home at least three times a week. Now I do neither. I'm back at work for two weeks to temporarily replace someone but my mom drops me off and picks me up; so still zero exercise. I've gained weight. I walk less; since I stay home more; and that's it. I wasn't very active before either about the same i still workout at home 0 Less activity; alone at home but for bigger periods of time It changed a lot; I don't see my friennds as often; very rarely. But everything right now is almost the same; because everything is open right now. The patterns haven't necessarily changed; I changed the excersises to adapt them to indoors life but I work the same muscular groups and systems. Physical activity not changed I walked a lot to get to work and since i work from home now I don't walk that much anymore They didn't change I have left the house less; and haven't been able to play with my friends outside I am not going to the gym anymore; I do less intense exercise but I walk much more. I take some walks in gardens and parks close to home. I exercise more often and try to get more steps in every day I exercise alone more often than before. I don't go to the gym anymore; and my activity is less intense. My activity patterns have become more active. I still excercise alone; however; I had more time to do it hence responding 7x a week in the previous questions. I've followed a routine where I jog or brisk walk at 7am in the morning; and yoga once I get home. The duration has become a lot longer too where I used to do it for 30 minutes; now I am out for an hour. I would like to think that my exercises had gotten more intense during the pandemic. I started going to gym because of pandemic; also I started jogging My physical activity patterns haven't changed A lot of change; for the worse Apart from changes in teaching in schools and traveling by foot or car rather than by bus; not that much changed. They haven't I do less activity; however I've started new activities like skating My activity patterns have not changed. I have become less active. I used to go 4 times a week qt the gym. Since the pandemic i do exercise at home  1-3 times a week.with lower intensity and with no equipment Somewhat I used to go to the gym ~2 times a week for half an hour on my own for strength training but now I don't. The rest of my exercise (walking) has remained the same. I walk on my own on most evenings for around forty minutes. Now is often spontaneous and less organized. They haven't changed Shorter periods of activity; less intense activity; no resistance training; less mild exercise (little to no walking) i don't go to the gym anymore they havrn';t 0 My activity pattern has not changed because i was always exercising at home and i was going for jogging on the streets. I used to go with my mates to the gym after class; carry my backpack and go to bus stops; go window shopping on malls and often jogged in the nights. Nowadays I just do some cardio in my living room and lift dumbbells. I'm much less active as I usually cycle to work and back but now I'm working remotely I don't do much fitness so it all stayed the same. i exercise more outside; instead of the gym I no longer play netball at all. I feel less motivated to do exercise on my own; so haven't been running much as I'm more bored of it now. Didn't change at all; now everything is the same. Staying at home more often it hasn't changed a lot; i just increased the amount of times that i went out for a walk Not much has changed for me personally Didn't change much. did not change the same More indoor activities and less strenuous activities. My activity patterns have not changed that much No change Before the pandemic; I played team sports a lot more and i was walking much more because of school I am active way less; since I don't have access to the gym. I compress my activity into a fewer number of days. More outside; same frequency i spend more time outside. I and my friedns dont walk gym reduced ; feeling anxious about being out Not changed much. Rarely/never went to gym. Activities performed outside mostly alone for walking; from 40 minutes to 1;5 hour almost daily. Not much effort needed; easy type of exercise Rarely in the gym at the moment; mostly training alone; frequency and duration is the same. I exercise less; but I try to do more mild effort physicall activity. nothing changed My activity patterns don't change at all but now I am training at home More strenuous exercise; much less mild and moderate exercise no shower in practice; start to train more alone i have been less active as i have been leaving the house less and my gym has been closed Less walking outside. No gym or interior activities Running During quarantine I started doing yoga daily for 3 months; I have kept it up until now for about 3 times a week. I used to exercise less before the pandemic because I felt more active in my daily life (running errands; going out with friends etc). During quarantine I was at home 24/7 which made me feel the need to consciously move my body/exercise. no I never really did exercise before but used to walk to work every day. It meant five days a week i was walking a minimum of 1 hour a day but now that I'm working from home; it means I'm moving less. I have started to work out at home instead of going to the gym. I used to go to gym; now I don't go I became more physically active thanks to the fact that for some weeks I needed to work from home - this sort of pushed me to work out more as I had fewer excuses not to. Also I wished to be more strong and healthy and have some control over it. I started following a weight lifting program at home to achieve this. I became more active and doing exercise at home I used to go out more; which made me walk more; now I'm mostly at home. Hasn't changed become more lazy and doing less activity inside Before the pandemic I exercised less and did it at home; although I ran outside more often. Now I try to use my space at home to exercise but I focuse more on pilates; aerobics; etc. before I trained at the gym; ran and walked. Now I train at home and don't walk as much 5 Less physical activity Due to physical disabilities; my normal exercise routine has been disrupted severly I used to attend regular exercise and dance classes several times a week; all of which have currently stopped. I used to swim for about an hour a week before the Covid-19 pandemic I used to regularly go to the gym; now I don't go at all. I haven't played group sports ever since the pandemic. I walk less; but started to do some trainning from home i abandoned gym for the calisthenics workout; im spending more time outside for example: cycling; walking The lenght; intensity and type of exercise has changed. I used to lift weight and had lot of social life Wich kept me active. Less interaction makes me stay at home and do less. I like group exercises and now I have to do it by myself so it is less it didn't change; i have becterew's so no sports allowed I stopped going to the gym; and I don't like to workout at home Walks every day; climbing stairs Doing things more often No I didn't exercise a lot before the Covid-19; but now I don't even walk on the street to go to work; or social activities The only exercise I get is a lot of walking; which isn't anything new; but I have been going outside a lot less compared to before the pandemic. physical activities only done outside; alone; following a bodybuilding regime did not really change Instead of going to a gym to use a treadmill I run/walk in the nearby park and forest I used to go to the gym almost daily to do cardio and weight training. I also often used their facilities to do yoga; swim and take group fitness classes. My exercise regimen was much more intense. Now I walk my dogs 1-3 miles per day only. Before I walked them 1-3 miles per day + went to the gym. I now have more time to exercise and I have learned ways to motivate myself when exercising at home I quit the gym I am a member of my University Hockey Team and have not been able to train or see my friends I can go to the gym in my dorm every day because I have more time; I couldn't go as much before the pandemic. I can stay longer (even more than one hour) and I do exercises that require more effort. Nothing changed im excersising more often but mostly at home alone I have become much more active more exercises just by myself; more selfcare it didin't changed bacause i have my own gym at home I just don't go to the gym. I workout in home. I'm just going out less frequently than before I don??????????t think it changed; really. not hard; I have a spinal injury and have trouble even sitting not to mention exercise all the activities are now only in small groups; rather not in public where there are many people. It is harder to engage in exercise by myself at my home; when I am used to the 'pree pressure' of being in a yoga class. This is why I work out less now. yes all workouts at home  - walking is the same as before but now I have all day to do as i like Everything changed; I work out more often with people. Exercising from home; running outdoors; taking long walks around the local area I am less active because I am always home During pandemic I had more time to do home workout. Now I'm working till late and I could not go to gym as well i stay a lot more at home; almost have never met my friends in person for months. I have worked out way less Same phsyical activity done the same way as prior to covid. Always alone; always at home. I now do more exercise at home instead of the gym; and less. Theres been no qalking to and from school , theres been less walking activities due to staying close to home  ",,
