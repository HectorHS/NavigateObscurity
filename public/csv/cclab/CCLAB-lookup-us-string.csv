Optimism7days,,,,,,"Covid infection rates; income Life is always a mixed bag - all in all we are very blessed to live at this time in this geolocation money; friends; food; My immediate health and financial situation I am one step closer to getting the vaccine. Nothing's really going to change in the next week. mumblings today by propaganda outlets indicate that falling numbers of covid cases are leveling off; so I worry that increasing restrictions in regards to simply living one's life are likely in the cards soon; supposed mutant variants of covid being transmitted. or How my date goes tomorrow night. weather control of pandemic That things are not going to get better until more people get vaccinate. Our society is still functioning fairly well. My income will increase due to COVID stimulus. There will be a general return to pre COVID normalcy. nothing More vaccine will be available chemotherapy paying my credit card bill; need to raise some money` how likely the positivity rate is to improve The steady decline in new cases and the ramping up of vaccine distribution I'm in quarantine from a potential exposure; so in 7 days I can leave my house Life will still be much the same as it is right now. whether I will have work completed We are still in the midst of the pandemic How well my family will be doing no changes the weather Things are beginning to look up but we're not there yet. Life in general How I will feel; how my family friends will be doing; how my neighbors will be doing; how many more bad  things for our country will Biden do all planets are direct (none are retrograde); which is very good. I am hopeful that I will get some things done around the house that I've been putting off. What I'll be doing; how likely it is that something bad will happen; what the weather will be like. More covid-19 shots actually being given. I think things will basically remain the same. money pandemic local covid recovery Being (un)able to obtain a vaccine; political climate; being unable to move to a better location. Not much will change in that time. I am thinking about how the COVID-19 pandemic will play out. I'm going on a trip to see my family. I'm hoping my current flare-up of chronic illness will have calmed Getting close to my second Covid shot. Weather getting warmer! My finances and what might happen to the economy. I think about how the numbers in my state have been steadily going down as of late. more vaccines; more help that very few things will change money and not being able to get the vaccine. more vaccines are happening and we are moving closer to her immunity still stuck at home Whether I will have work Day to day things like what TV shows I might be watching or what I'll buy for groceries next week. Nothing new is expected in 7 days I think about how they are sending children back to school full time and how the virus might get worse Weather will be warmer. Work i expect things to be the same covid deaths I am worried about finances for the next several days but hopeful something postive may happen Right wing extremists might be planning another attack. More strains of Covid are emerging. Covid; work Finishing a work project My physical and mental health COVID; warmer weather things happening around my home current state of events is unlikely to change in 7 days I think that I'll make it through another work week and I'm grateful for income. nothing major will happen The state of the country with respect to COVID-19 and my job situation. my thoughts of the news cycle I think about how things are today and imagine they won't be that much different; it could be a good or bad day. No change In life; remote work; zoom with family; no travel My health more people getting vaccinated and closer to normalcy Depends on how I'm feeling or what's going on. Rent will be paid; I am not too short of cash; feeling reasonably well; doing fine for groceries; staying safe. warmer weather Nothing will change in such a short time span. The general trends of politics; my own life experiences; hope for the future. what is going on with covid situation Seeing my girlfriend makes me optimistic. fate Nice home; health; family completing my work assignment The fact that it seems very tangible to me and close to fruition. It still doesn't take away the fact 500;000 Americans have perished from Covid-19; but I see it as being overwhelmingly optimistic. It's more of a spiritual feeling and not a physical/rational feeling. 7 days from now will be a weekend which is nice (I don't particularly like my job; so weekdays are tough) going to lunch with a friend and then going shoppini I just don't know anymore. Everyday seems to just go by and I'm not getting anywhere in life. I'm frustrated but trying to have a good outlook on things but it's getting hard.

My Social Security will have started; and my finances will be in much better shape. I am hoping I can get my goals of setting up my own firm and making it profitable so I will not have to worry about money and not living life to the full. I think about how we will go through rough economic times but it will get better and hopefully be improved in a decade. retiring older yet probably more deep issues Getting older and getting poorer and getting screwed over more by the banks; governments and those in power. hope we learn from this situation and stay clear of future pandemics or know how to deal with them quickly I will be dead Where I am in my life Political problems; economic problems; etc that will effect the whole country.

I believe it will become clearer the nature of our challenges socially; environmentally; with regard to climate change; international relations; and interconnectedness generally; and about appropriate actions to address and meet these challenges accordingly.  But at the same time it is hard to be certain just what may happen between now and then; or what new challenges and conflicts might develop; so my optimism is tempered. better society the arc of history tends upward towards progress.

How the covid situation will be long gone Who is president and what measures are in place. life Nice home; health; family; travel the climate and world peace I can barely ""see"" 2 weeks from now. I thought about going to my last NBA game (in-person) with thousands of people not wearing masks and how 2 weeks later local governments were doing shelter in place with nightly curfews. 10 years is a lot of ground to cover. I hope things will be better; but also worry about things like climate change. honestly sure I'm hoping in 10 years from now my whole life is completely different. So different that I am not even able to imagine it. I think the country will be doing well if we can keep sane people in office and not the likes of the Trump administration.  I am optimistic that we will but worry a little because of the horror that was the last 4 years.  Personally; my husband and I will be aging but our daughter will be doing well and bringing us more joy. Hopefully no remains of COVID left Everything will be fine better clarification I think about having a nice house that I'm saving for. That will make me happy. better cooperation between people closer to biden going to jail Unsure about 10 years from now; I don't think I will be here by then.

THE FACT I WILL LIKELY BE RETIRED AND DOING THINGS WITH MY WIFE AND FAMILY I probably wont be here Hopefully someone of the problems were facing now will be resolved with the new administration.

Things will be better off in the world as for health; finances will be better; enjoyment more This depends a lot on the political situation in the U.S. & whether or not trump & his followers are no longer in the picture. the devastation of the environment This system is not going to get any better That we don't ever have a recurrent with what happen 10 years ago. i think; or hope; this will be all behind us knowing better how to cope; beinbg better prepared I have no real data and there is much that could happen; but by my nature; optimistic I am getting old but not yet frail That's a lot of time for things to change Financial struggle hopefully will be past pandemic and economy will improve and people will have learned to get along better health concerns how I'm personally feeling I am optimistic about life in general when it comes to any pandemic that may happen again because we all know what to do in case it happens again.

I'm hoping that the world will be a better place for everyone. assention Not having enough money for retirement Things will be back to normal and our lives will be improved from what they are today. Money and death I'll be retired which makes me very optimistic. the former president will attempt another power grab; at the cost of more human lives.

The pandemic might continue; but climate change; polarization; political issues worsen I will have my current issues straightened out. I try not to think that far ahead. But I'm committed to the idea that being flexible and adapting to change are the keys to being able to continue doing what is most important to me. Negative emotions; though; are hindering me. And too little money. better I will be close to 75 years old and my health will be less than it is today. growth of my 2 yr old grandson; stability of my son's life; more personal freedom; Preventing authoritarian government takeover The ""new"" normal will have set it and people will feel more secure about going about their daily lives.

Back to normal living climate change; racism; lack of people caring about one another; people struggling financially; corruption health at my resent age if I live this long being 75 at this time and in good health and remaining active More pandemics That in 10 years something else will come along Hoping I am still healthy who knows?

I think it will be normal Being happy climate change will be worse; maybe new viruses will be here long time I see myself as not only a non-smoker; but taking a lot better care of myself; and my surroundings. Hopefully we will have learned how to deal with the virus and it's variants. people forgetting about trump No worries I'm 64 and reasonably healthy.

Trump's re-election in 2024 things turn around. Sanity is restored. My health and family What are the current Covid trends then My finances will likely improve. I will be much older and not able to do as much as I do now. Good things for my family. I hope people shake off the damage done by Biden and we can get back to normal Maybe I'll be in heaven Civil war; doubt i'll live that long though. I really can't say; and I think things will even out to reasonable mediocrity. The number of infected people. The number of covid deaths. The conomy. COVID gone nearing retirement with sufficient wherewithal to feel carefree I think things will be back to normal and there will be more advancements in science/tech/health care. I think about how the world will probably have new technologies and hopefully be more progressive and take care of its citizens; but; something like global warming could mean the world is worse 10 years from now. The state of the world under the radical liberal agenda. If they keep controlling things; we won't have much of a ""United"" states anymore. What will life be like after a pandemic COVID won't continue to be a big problem.  New problems may arise. the pandemic will be over and I will hopefully be alive Technology will improve and make life better; safer and cheaper just a guess 10 years from now; I am very optimistic about the success and stability of our own business. I think about how I will be living somewhere I love and feel relaxed and around people who are friendly; kind and considerate. People don't change...hopefully government will change We are going to be in better shape or much worse Covid will be gone and life will have gotten better 10 years is quite a length of time and a lot can happen in time; good or bad I'm not sure I will still be alive. It's mostly a guess; I'm hopeful but I don't really know. It is too far out there for me to even know what will be in my life; but I choose to think things will be even better than they are now. Things will progress. Economy; Personal interaction; Unrest; World events don't know how things will be I think about having a normal life with no coronavirus; being able to enjoy life; going to various places without fear of becoming sick due to the coronavirus. Normal life-no pandemic Climate Change; Automation; Water Shortages Covid being more of a memory than in the forefront I hope to be retired living somewhere in the tropics with no snow. My health; the next president my husband's health I will have a stable career. I am not a fortune teller; hard to say if i'll even be alive by then Covid will be over and we will hopefully be better prepared as a nation to handle any future pandemic. See grandchildren be successful Lot of societal decay may occur in this time frame. our society dealing with racism and fixing our police brutality problem; as well as weaning ourselves off of fossil fuels and onto solar and wind power I think about other viruses similar to the coronavirus and global warming and how that will effect us if nothing is done large scale shifts in the political landscape life improvements Climate change events will be worse; not sure if country will be cohesive; if we have 4 more years of Trump(or Jr.) we are back to pre-covid situation. I guess it. that advancements in medical science and technology will make the world a better and more equitable place america will be fucked and i maybe dead by then or in bad health Now that makes me think of Covid and it will be gone by then. Hopefully 10 years will be long enough to remove the liars and cheaters from Washington and get some good people in there who will work together and want this country back together more than they want their party to win. somewhat back to the new normal; able to move about freely I worry about the downward spiral of the climate. I think about myself; friends and family.

War or not? I am fairly pessimistic about what things will be like 10 years from now if the direction the country is now taking continues. the world changes everyday and this is just the start.  Worse is yet to come Advances in health; science; the world; my community; my health; an end to COVID-19; and financial independence. Age money Retirement family members normalcy Dr. Fauci may not be alive Very pessimistic about climate change; disease; war; polarization; nearly everything. friends family my health during retirement Impossible to tell what will happen; but always want to be hopeful. that maybe our younger generation will see that we're better working together than working against each other that climate change will be worse and the US will be worse off too Not sure My future Will the country be less divided than it is now I will be dead not a part of it I think the pandemic will be over. I think we will be able to live normally. climate change current pandemic under control.  optimistic that cooler heads prevail My bank account. Owning a home. More people will have received the vaccine What sort of jobs I might be doing and where I might be living; what my life in general might be like; what sort of politicians might be elected and what sort of policies might be enacted. Who knows what'll happen to this world 10 years from now with war; famine; climate change. Hopefully things in the world will be a little bit better. capitalism will still destroy us My career That i will be older and forgetful No masks Whether anything significant will happen aftermath of COVID and effects of climat change I will be fully retired and enjoying my free time i dont really think about the future Hopefully; the pandemic will be history and the economy rebounded... people are back to work; school and thriving. the health and happiness of my kids Every day is a good day. Although I am concerned about the individual rights and freedoms of individuals to speak their minds without retribution for their livelihoods How the Left will continue to exploit the pandemic for their own purposes. Stability and growth I think climate change is only going to get worse; and it's hard to know how much more damage will have been caused by humans 10 years from now (I think it will be a lot); I will be in my 40s and that is very terrifying because I haven't gotten to a point in my adult life where I'm happy yet (I haven't met a partner; e.g.) Other things will happen; whether it's related to disease or not. Advances in medicine. travelling Pessimistic on what new obstacle do we have to overcome now with our health strenth better economy; less political divisiveness The pandemic will be over and life will be much like what it was like a year ago. pandemic resolved many scientific improvements dealing with climate change - social evolution By this point; leftists will all be dead or rehabilitated. new era I would be optimistic about my financial prospects; and my family. My health will be failing How current issues we face will evolve over time The future in general looks bleak; so I am guarded and not hopeful that things will be better in 10 years. Normalcy I honestly can't think that far ahead so my thoughts on that are the same as five years; etc. Less civil unrest Have a loving family and we'll situated having a good life settled health reasons Will I still be around? Thoughts about business and where I will be then. Establishing a career Family; smart planning. We may get more help towards solving environmental problems and other human conditions for people; especially my family. Hopefully being alive still; I have survived 9 yrs so far from 2 cancers. I hope and pray that we will return back to God!! health; financual uncertainties health and finances; housing old age I'm wondering how many people I love who are older will be dying by then. the economy I wonder what the toll on people will be in 10 years after this terrible year of crisis. I will be close to retirement The fact that I will hopefully have gotten many more promotions Freedom General opttimism Hopefully the human race will be more successful at preserving itself. Relax financial security i will be closer to retirement the virus should be behind us and medicine/technology will be better able to fight the next pandemic (for example; improvements on mRNA type break throughs) global warming; political dissent Possibly a real president fairly elected. Global warming My dogs. Life; money; work Fear of complete stagnation and even more decline in lifestyle but also hope that I can turn my life around completely Worsening global warming; more war I want to be able to go to concerts. weather Hopefully this pandemic will be a faint memory. Not wearing a mask Whether I can make enough maoney to provide for my wife and I. Health and income Too far away Economy I hope to have started my own business and be much more financially secure. Global warming; inequality technology plus knowledge I will change my future. Covid will be a thing of the pass Ability to identify viruses easily and better equipped to handle this Hopefully by this time; we will have had a much better control over this disease and it only occurs seasonally (such as the seasonal flu) and is significantly less severe. Am I going to be living with family? Will I have found someone? How much of my TBI will stay; what new fun hurdles will I have? I don't think I will be alive 10 years from now. I am hoping ten years from now I will be divorced and living on my own; surrounded by friends with no pandemc in sight. this will be behind us and lessons will have been learned CLIMATE CHANGE MAY BE WORSE BUT I THINK ILL PERSONALLY BE IN A BETTER POSITION Retirement What will the state of my country/world be in 10 years from now?                                                                                  job opportunities ;housing Maybe I'll have a family by then The pandemic will be over and everyone will be back to normal. Hopefully the world will be more at peace. I feel that in 10 years global warming will be worse; populations too large and limited supplies available. covid vaccine Economic getting older makes me pessimistic Whether I'll still be alive; and how my health will be then. Hopefully then i am successful in all ramifications and  i am at the point were i can enjoy my wealth very optimistic People will have forgotten about COVID and we will be carrying on with our regular lives finding something new to worry about stability of my country The trends of the last century are not changing. my own future my health; hopefully moving from my current location and being in a better place emotionally My children moving on with their lives I will be a established person in my society. It's difficult to imagine what will happen that far out Over population leading to war I surround myself with positive people who help me to appreciate the good in situations and in life in general. too hard to predict; I hope much better hoping I'm dead by then. not being secure; still suffering under capitalism/white america Personal growth; grandchildren; getting married; traveling; enjoying life to the fullest Racism I focus on good things as challenges are part of life. How successful I will be in wealth and well-being I decent life the joy of life my future hope that maybe we will have some political changes that will help this country and the planet Will other pandemics be around Nothing I think future technologies.

QAnonDescribe,,,,,,,"All I know is he/she is a right-wing conspiracy-theorist. I don't really know what that is I believe that QAnon is very dangerous as people are susceptible to these lies.  I think that QAnon shows us how easy it is to manipulate people using new forms of social media.  I am worried that QAnon will continue to be prevalent due to the use of social media. I believe this is an evil group. They believe in hate and racism. generally these people are gullible, im not sure about dangerous though A liberal joke gone horribly wrong. Fuck Trump and all his supporters. QAnon adherents have a belief system that is detached from reality. They are apt to believe conspiracy theories, and some will take violent actions because of their beliefs. They're disgusting. They're ridiculous. They should receive a lot of attention from law enforcement. I don't agree with them. I had to look up what they were! radicalized nationalist fascists looking to overthrow the US government and return the US to at least Jim Crow if not outright slavery and everything fucked up in that era that these morons think are good things They're domestic homegrown terroirist. They're full of conspiracy theories and ""alternative facts"" They are one of th biggest threats facing USA today A group of idiots that are entertaining to troll on social media. Somewhat worrisome that they have stuck around as long as they have and have even made inroads to the federal government.   I suspect that they will fade way in a few years. It's a ridiculous conspiracy theory that has really played into people who are mentally vulnerable. They're angry and want somewhere to place the blame. A conspiracy theory for far right lunatics who are completely detached from reality. I have only heard their name. I don't know much about them I think QAnon is a basket case of easily influenced humans They seem to exist outside of reality. They are dangerous. Don???t know much about it at all, and don???t want to. I am embarrassed.  I know nothing about them. I have read some but not much of Q- I think they touch on some truth or else the MSM would not be hating on them.  I have no idea who Q is and have not formed an opinion on them, as I pay little attention to Q or the MSM. I think its a group of people that choose to believe in an alternate reality that suits their belief system. I am reluctantly starting to believe that these people really exist and are in our congress.  It's embarrassing. I think that it has turned into something close to a religious cult, and that it will continue to change with new developments and be very difficult to get people away from once they thoroughly commit. I find QAnon to be a threat because it encourages the spread of misinformation about people, organizations, etc.  It's very dangerous because there are now SO many more people who believe the crazy ideas that they propagate.  And some are willing to use whatever means necessary to get what they want.  Very scary time in the country right now.  I don't know what happened to plain old common sense. They are somewhat worrisome. While I do believe that sometimes the government tries to hide things, I think their thinking is way out there. Some of these people are extremely racist. Some are dangerous. They can be manipulated by their higher power s. QAnon is dangerous in that it encourages ridiculous conspiracy theories that take on a life of their own. Too many people not only believe this nonsense, but act on it, leading to chaos. I feel QAnon has tried to expose a lot of truth that is suppressed from most American citizens. I think QAnon serves a purpose as all people do not believe what the media portrays as reality. I don't care about it. It's primarily something irrelevant the media hypes up. QAnon shows how the internet can be used to influence people who are unable to accurate tell what is true and what is false.  I look at QAnon they same way I look at other cults. I think this is the second time I've been asked about QAnon. I looked them up after the last time but I can't remember anything about them except some sort of extremism. I don't feel like they are very relevant or worrisome. Even though it is largely made up of idiots, it's still dangerous in a partisan world with the Primary System of elections. I think there's a special place in Hell for those that take advantage of these people for their own selfish reasons even when they know better. I have heard of them and never thought much about them.  Most of what they claimed never came to pass.  In addition I am not one to believe in conspiracy claims but I do think so called truthful and ""good,"" guys can be the opposite of what they claim.  Human affairs are like an iceberg to me as we can only see so much but much more remains hidden no matter what mostly. I think it was started by people looking to profit off of other people's fears by publishing videos meant to titillate on YouTube.  By playing on people's fears, these people have made money off views on social media.  So, it is all fake and people are being duped by a bunch of profiteers. no idea.  I never researched it. weirdness that has a forum. A far right group who believe in government conspiracies. They stormed the Capitol building January 6th while the electoral college were finalizing the votes. I have no opinion. They are dangerous because they fill in the gaps in information the government lies about/refuses to release all information. Basically, it's a symptom of governments that mislead the public for various reasons (not conspiracy related) and that then creates mistrust in every statement or action. I have a low opinion towards QAnon and feel glad that most people have moved past caring about that sort of thing now. Don???t know they are a bunch of delusional people who are searching for meaning in all the wrong places I don't know much about QAnon. Only familiar with the name Stupid shit from 4chan that idiots fell for. I think it is certainly possible this could be a big threat for our country.  I don't think that it will be much of a threat though, going forward, to this country I think it was started by a kook who wanted attention. It seems to mainly be followed by people who have lower IQ'S and who will latch on to any extreme theory because they don't reason things out. It's ridiculous and I'm baffled at how so many grown people would fall for it. It's like a cult and it seems to somehow hypnotize people and it causes them to lose their grasp on reality. Several of my family members seem to be affected. Somehow the media that they indulge in is influencing them in a really scary way. It's insane, but the idea that they represent an actual threat by white-supremacists are the like is also insane. They're nutcases from the internet who could just be ignored. There's been a long running anti-intellectualism culture in the United States that is currently going though a high point. Fortunately, all of these people are completely changeable, and will fall prey to the ""next big thing"" that they are told to believe. It's an absurd delusion. QAnon is a far-right conspiracy theory. Wacko and dangerous idiots. It is a weird cult, and I do not understand how anyone could believe such obvious nonsense. QAnon is total bullshit and so are the people that follow it. It???s hard to believe people can be so stupid when we have access to so many educational choices. STUPID PROPAGANDA They are a bad group of people. The internet is full of bad information and they believe it. We need more fact checkers to clear the record. I think it's a group of people who have very low information literacy who have been convinced that their way of life is under serious threat by the ideas of diversity and equality because a group of liberal elites are using this division to gain political and economic power over all nations. Left wing violent advocates young people being falsely misled intentionally to create chaos I imagine Trump losing the election hurt the movement, but it is a worry that people in general are believing conspiracy theories that have no basis in fact and that people trust random Facebook posts compared to credible news outlets. It's a propaganda site that spews lies.  I dislike it for spreading conspiracy theories.  I feel like they make up the most outlandish story and see how many of their followers will believe and spread it.  I think their dangerous because there's nothing they won't say or do. This is an absurdity beyond the reach of my imagination.  I have difficulty grasping that so many people could grant plausibility to such ideas, and feel worse to think of what they must really feel and believe about the things they do know something about, and what influences them. I don't follow the news that much, but from what I know QAnon is not a good organization. I think they are deceived and being manipulated into doing things to serve the purposes of others. I think that the members that believe what QAnon states have fallen for some very dangerous lies.  I think they should be monitored by the government, if they are not already doing so. My thoughts and feelings about QAnon is that I don't think about it. I think it is something that the government and the mainstream media put a spin on to make it something that it is not. I'm angry that they try and undermine the truth and spout unproven conspiracy theories to spread lies and fear. It is a bunch of conspiracy nuts who believe anything and are traitors to the United States. never heard of them they are a conspiracy and cult group around Trump and I believe they are dangerous It is a group of conspiracy theorists who believe very bizarre things. They are usually right-wing Republicans. It is complete malarkey. I highly doubt some government official is releasing information under the name of Q. It is complete bullshit designed to confuse confused people. I have never heard of QAnon It's a cult fueled by hate. Too many uneducated morons are running around thinking their theories are reality. They're a danger to society. I am not sure I feel anything about it It's nuts. Something about satanic pedophiles and crap.I have no clue what that's all about. QAnon is a very dangerous cult.  Originally I believe they started with the belief that someone was running a global child trafficking ring and conspiring against Donald Trump.  Sadly there are millions in this far right cult that believe in outrageous conspiracy theories.  I feel very negative towards them and think they are destructive and capable of even more destruction. These guys are the most extreme trump supporters. They are grossly mislead and willing to do anything. They are also directed by the white house. I think it is a bunch of made-up nonsense. The nonsense can have dangerous undertones to it which could lead top serious problems. I am particularly concerned about how the misinformation of something like Qanon spreads via social media. I think people are pretty prevalent to misinformation spreading and staying through it. It is a legitimate terrorist organization and should be looked into immediately. I have no idea what QAnon is. This group has a severe mental illness that needs to be made an example of from our government. I don't believe it at all. I feel neutral about it because it doesn't matter. I don't think it's worth thinking about. They are trouble. They are full of delusion. They are trying to undermine democracy. I have never heard of it I think they are a growing force of like minded Americans that is ""biding their time"" to strike and attempt to take over major parts of the government. PATRIOTIC GROUP QAnon is a far-right conspiracy theory that has been discredited and disproved but has been pushed by groups trying to further divide Americans. The claim that QAnon is a secret society/group that worship Satan, eat people and sex-traffic children is completely idiotic. I think it's a completely bizarre and nonsensical conspiracy theory that's actively harmful both to society and to individual family and friendship and so on relationships. I hope that it will fade some now that the predictions keep not coming true, but some people seem to really keep holding onto it. I hope they don't get sucked into even worse things. They are a bunch of tin hat yahoos QAnon is a weird conspiracy theory, the threat is probably overhyped by the media but sometimes people who are too invested in conspiracy theories do dangerous things so it's not harmless. Crazy nuts who have lost their minds. From what I know of QAnon I believe seeing them as a threat is propaganda and disinformation perpetrated by the radical left and socialists QAnon is a conspiracy theory that is spreading among right wingers.  Each day there is a new theory that these people will present.  None of this is true, and people should stop believing what they hear. Qanon is an extremist group, and any extremist group can cause problems I have no thoughts or feelings about QAnon I think it is too small to impact us Not sure it is a real threat I know next to nothing about them. Conservatives going off the deep end, buying into a conspiratorial blend of revamped blood libel and Turner Diaries apocalypticism They are a dangerour group of Trump folllowers who pose a threat to our country and out democracy. They need to be arrested and held accountable for their actions on January 6 and then some. I think it's a tragic misuse of the internet to mislead vulnerable people into causing themselves, their relationships, and their community. I do harbor some disdain and ill-will towards members of the movement because I think they're not looking out for me or my families best interests. a bunch of nuts I have none. I do not know anything about them. There is a possibility that they could be a threat in the future QAnon involves a combination of conspiracy theories that for the most part, are false and idiotic. There are a few shreds of QAnon info which sounds somewhat plausible which is how it attracts even those who are otherwise intelligent. Once they can capture someone's attention, they begin brainwashing their followers in multiple ways, just as your typical cult. WITH THE POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN THE COUNTRY NOW I FEEL QANON CAN HAVE A BIGGER THREAT THAN ONE YEAR AGO. I FEEL WITH THE CHANGE IN THE PRSIDENCY I FEEL THIS THREAT HAS DECREASED SOME IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS. What is QAnon. I am not familiar I don't know what that is QAnon is a completely ridiculous conspiracy theory with no basis in facts or truth. It has unfortunately become adopted by enough people that this wider support has somehow further legitimized it's false claims. I have no respect for those who believe QAnon's lies. Nothing good ever comes from blind followers of conspiracies.  They are tools of manipulation for power-hungry demagogues to achieve their own agendas and those agendas usually exclude the greater good of society. Q is/was a clever way to get people interested in looking for facts themselves instead of just believing what they hear on the news. I'm not positive, but I think Anons are just miscellaneous anonymous people who interacted with Q by making comments on the site where Q left information. I don't think there is anything called QAnon. I think Q was a great idea. There is nothing weird about the information left by Q. It's just hints, and people can research for themselves and make up their own minds what to think. a bunch of wackos A group of consipiracist who met online, i guess its good they have a social group, but there ideas, are strange to say the least.  Maybe intellignce isn't one of their strengths. I am not aware of this nor have I ready anything about QAnon I think that they are as radical as antifa, but not as violent and neither are good for our country. i dont know what it is It is to unpredictable.I am not sure about it. I think QAnon should be categorized as a domestic terror group or a cult. I honestly don't know enough about it to give an honest opinion. People who believe it are nuts. I am not really sure who they are actually. I am trying to avoid negativity as far as those things go. I dont follow the group or what it stands for at all. Based just on basic specifics of what it believes I dont give any creedence to it. Radical crazy Fox watching republican lunatics I feel the lies they spread is causing people to loose their minds. If this is a cult as stated then my thoughts of them are very negative and my feelings is that I would never involve myself with someone dictating my life. grasping for straws, the media makes them look more influential than they actually are I have no concerns about it at all. I feel that it is just a voice that has it's own opinions, right or wrong. There is no security conerns from it. People who have abandoned religion need something to believe in, no matter how far-fetched. It seemed unbelievable to me at first that such an organization existed with such faithful members, but here we are. Sigh. Bunch of idiots went down the rabbit hole, now completely unhinged from reality. It's a very interesting study of fear.  Almost like the Salem witch trials.  I know a few people who are caught up in it. they are  normally very king, loving people and have been a great help tome when no one else was. They are terrified. It is extremely unfortunate that you can't reason with Fear.=d. Honestly I don't know much about it I assume there is some truth to some of the things they say, but it seems like a cult with its own agenda. It's a waste of time and thought. a conspiracy group that is so far out that believe Democrats are evil and Trump is our savior I think the organization of QAnon are a cult of people who want to disrupt our democratic system anyway that they can. These people create conspiracies when there are none. They create chaos just to see what type of results will happen. QAnon folks just want to see the economy dwindle and they have no foresight on what to do next if something like that did happen. I don't really have any feelings about them, I just wish they would go away. confused people i dont know much about them, what i have heard i dont believe QAnon is cultlike and preys on people who are disenfranchised or fearful.  They are a threat in that people are caught up in their rhetoric which is not based on logic and is emotionally charged....primarily with fear and distrust.  The lies are seen as truth even when they are disproven by the very events predicted, etc.  This, combined with the tendency toward violence is a threat. I'm angry at how QAnon as allowed to infiltrate our social media without the media companies taking measures to control it. The false and dangerous information pushed by the people believing in it has been harmful to our country. I think QAnon is very dangerous and can lead to dangerous actions by people that believe in it.  I also think the QAnon nonsense distracts from real issues that need to be addressed.  I think QAnon grew out of people being stuck at home during COVID and needing entertainment. People living in a dream world, hoping that what they want becomes reality and if it doesn't they will find another agenda It is absurd. The people are disgusting. It is a waste of society's financial resources and potential human progress to have to deal with this absolute nonsense. Delusional angry bitter small minded fools Kooks and crackpots causing trouble for themselves and others. QAnon is extremely problematic and should be viewed for what it is: domestic terrorism. I think that disinformation is extremely rampant and troubling, and groups like QAnon are responsible. I stopped watching all news after the  2021 election was stolen by the Dems. I honestly don't know what Q Anon is . There is so much corruption and so much destruction now at the hands of the communists/ Dems that I have abandoned all of it . I watch TV shows from the 1950's and 60's now all day  on the family channel. I used to watch politics all day every day on Fox but I am DONE with all of it . Forever . Not enough information to give my conclusuion I think it is like a cult and is an organization which creates lies to suit an agenda and to cater to the paranoia and worldview of its followers. Ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Radical nuts that live in an alternate universe. QAnon spreads complete falsehoods.  The theories put forth by QAnon make no sense, are wildly conspiratorial and are not backed up by any evidence at all.  i do no understand how anyone thinks there is any truth to these ideas.  I'm frustrated by how many people are willing to think QAnons ideas are true. They seem like a bunch of conspiracy nuts. They are just as crazy as people pushing the New green deal and Joe Biden's handlers. they have some very strange beliefs. they seem to be attracting new members I believe its a cuktlike organization. Its based on scare tactics and bigotry Total batch of idiots who have fallen for the trash conspiracies. delusional and dangerous I don't support QAnon.  I don't believe in their practices.. They seem outlandish. I don't know anything about it. A bunch of fanatics who base their feelings on unproven conspiracy theories. there is no such thing as QAnon,  there is Q and there are anons...please do some research before you start asking stupid questions about something you've been told by someone who has no knowledge other than what media has told them. I have never heard of this organization so I looked it up. I really hope it is not true. I think they are a radial Organization that is trying to get their agenda across through sometimes violent means and trying to disrupt America to cause a civil war. QAnon is a domestic terrorist group whose members staged a coup on the US government and whose members should be rounded up and tried for sedition and summarily executed for these high crimes. I think QAnon adherents are either mentally ill or not very bright. The entire premise is ridiculous. They have already engaged in violence at the Capitol and enough is enough. Stupid, repulsive little people with no common sense and no regard for their fellow human beings. QAnon was a JOKE and idiots fell for it, as idiots do. They are a danger because they will NEVER see that they are wrong. I think it speaks truth. People are scared because of the truth they say. Facts are facts. It's a very dangerous phenomenon which threatens our very democracy because it undermines people's ability to discern truth from false statements proffered by people who seek to exert control in some way, or seek to gain power I have no idea what is qanon They seem like a group that is out of touch with reality. They refuse to acknowledge the truth and facts that exist about our country and its politics. It seems like an extremist cult. IT IS NOT SOMETHING CONFIRMED. They have the right to their opinions I have no idea. I feel like it is supremacy and they are a dangerous group that cannot be compared to Black Lives Matter. The followers of Q are telling everyone to relax and watch the movie, to sit tight, there is a plan. To do nothing. So, yes, the anon's covering of Q drops is a threat to American security as Q is a Psyop and nothing good is indeed ""habbening"". The group is very detrimental not only to it's members, but also to society. There are times I wonder if the Russians are behind this group in order to cause disruption and confusion within the US. It is absolutely insane and only the uneducated or thoroughly anti-social people could ever believe it. It???s a cult I don't know enough about then to make that determination. From what I know, I do not believe this is a threat, but I also do not follow very closely. I honestly haven't been following the QAnon thing. Pretty sure it's, like, a cult for Trump fans. Not a good thing. They are typically mean folks that are also evil. They are on the killing side life. They are a tool used to push people who normally would not believe such nonsense into other actions A bunch of nut cases that believe what they want to hear. Scary I think they are extremists that are threatening and violent It is a dangerous cult that social media has helped grow across the country. It has broken up families and has become a threat to our national security. There is a person called ""Q"" who is knowledgeable about conspiracies.  I do not feel concerned about QAnon. Terrorist organization of psychotic old white folk. I don't have much of an opinion on it at all. I have an opinion and feel strongly about the political and social events that you mentioned above but as far as QAnon, I don't pay any attention to what is being said at all. I don't have any particular ideas about it Where is it, what is it? And I think it is just more trash talk from the Media and the Democrats lunatics QAnon is a very dangerous group of people who seem to be hellbent in destroying our country as we know it. They spread rumor and conspiracy theories with no proof. I know almost nothing about them, other than that the Left is using the name to try to smear conservatives. I don't think about them I think that group of people are afriad of other groups of people dangerous assholes. it is a bunch of crap People who are sheep and think they are smart but actually dont use logic. I don't know much about them Crazy people with weird conspiracy theories. Its a marketing scheme. Based upon little to no evidence I am not familiar enough with the 'organization' known as QAnon. I know very little about them so I can't judge. I am unfamiliar with QAnon. dont know who that is They're crazy psychos. Its a deranged conspiracy theory. The spread of Qanon shows our education system needs more funding. It's a massive grift in the form of a conspiracy theory, and now that Trump's lost they're actually pivoting to vaccine misinformation. Which proves it was always all lies, but people are already invested so they don't care. It's bad and it's probably going to get more people killed. not-normal thinking people, something goes wrong in their brain / I don't know much about QAnon to be able to make any kind of assumptions. I don't think they are a danger to anyone though because it just seems to be an online thing. none The fact that so many people are Q-anon believers is a threat to the country and to democracy. That is someone or a small group that try to guess trends and lead on followers about possible future events. Utter nonsense. Irresponsible fantasy. An not show if I can trust QAnon but leaning more not trusting them I think it reflects a lot of stress and worry that peple carry. I think it reflects a lot of uncritical thinking. I think that it is a symptom that should be addressed by individuals,  community leaders, and larger organisations with a loudspeaker. People need to understand and realize the value and dignity of life: their own and others. And, place respect for that in our selves and other people's lives. Moronic nonsense spread to low info people by some with an agenda. I think these people are definitely a threat to the American way of life. They are dangerous to democracy in our country. I think they are out of their minds. I think the pandemic has caused people who were on the brink of mental illness to cross over. I am astonished that a set of outlandish conspiracy theories could take root so strongly in our society. Qanon is a cult that is readily accepted by weak minded individuals who are prone to believe conspiracys cult of trump followers and racists ....cannot stand them I think they have some strange conspiracy theories I cannot understand why QAnon is given so much credibility, or why it appeals to the number of people it does. People are ridiculous, believing something that stupid makes me think that the human race is an evolutionary dead end. I believe it was an internet joke that caught on that now people actually believe. I know nothing about them, except read they were against Democrates who were doing things to children I have nothing good to say about this. It's a crazy conspiracy theory group that is trying to destablize our governemnt and our society ona  grass roots level. Qanon is a conspiracy theory believed by gullible, unintelligent people with poor analytical thinking skills. I also believe the Qanon conpiracy theory is based on racism, sexism and xenophobia. The QAnon phenomenon is idiotic but typical of the normal American consumer. I feel it is a huge distraction and disappointing to witness. I actually don't hear anything about it any more. I think that kind of thing dies off in silence. I have no thoughts or feeling about QAnon QAnon is a dangerous group of complete idiots so loyal to Donald Trump, they'll kill others. It is a dangerous cult.  Based on absolute nonsense. don't know anything about them I think it's a bunch of nonsense dreamed up by far right lunatics. A bunch of people who believe a bunch of stupid shit that make Tom Cruise and Scientologists look sane all the while telling Scientologists how stupid the shit they claim to be is I do npt think about it ever,  I don't have time for that. Don't have a well-developed feeling about them I wish people would realize it's a bunch of nonsense, and dangerous. they are stupid I have to look it up.  What is QAnon? I think they are dangerous and cannot be trusted. a couple of people who wanted to see how many people they could fool. just like trump. I am surprised at how many people buy into this conspiracy theory. I think some people are looking for a way to blame the government for something, and this just fit the bill. I think it could get more and more dangerous. Dangerous bullshit I really dont have any thoughts They really need to stop behaving so poorly. It's annoying that a small group of people can cause so much trouble for everyone else. I do not know what to make of QAnon. I dont know how real they are or what they really stand for. Extremist group, targeting groups with hate and discrimination. A lot of them are dangerous lunatics that need to be locked up or put under some kind of around the clock surveillance. They terrify me because they seem to have brainwashed people I use to feel were logical and trustworthy to be around I don't know enough about QAnon to form a real opinion. I feel like there is much misleading information about this organization. I am not sure what QAnon is but the group seems to be anti government I don't know much about QAnon.  About all I know is that they are on the opposite end of the political perspective from me. They believe everything trump tells them and they act on that. I feel that they are a disgrace to America and our people. Dangerous morons A very paranoid or speculative group of people who believe conspiracies too often without thinking much The people who believe in QAnon are mentally ill, unstable and violent. It hasnt been proven yet People now believe that QAnon was a PsyOp (Psychological Operation) executed by one of the Intelligence Services. It was meant to keep people distracted from what was really going on. I just dont believe in a secret agency is masterminding this country I don't really understand what it is. I think it's something made up by some nutty extreme right wing people. QAnon I have only heard the name but I don't know anything about it. I don't have thoughts  or feelings toward Qanon.  I don't believe it exists. I don't know what the group stands for. Strange people who have no real influence They are terrorists that should be disbanded and/or arrested. Mostly a bogeyman created by the media to scare people into compliance and passing favorable legislation, similar to middle eastern terrorism in the 00s. There are a lot of people that don't want to live in the world the elites are creating and they're given no legitimate alternatives, which pushes them into joining conspiracy theory type movements but they aren't a real threat, Qanon is a sort of escapism from ""clown world"" They're a danger and an embarrassment to American society. I wish all the QAnoners would wake up and stop buying into this mass delusion. No one knows that much about them so they are a kind of mysterious. I think they're a real group,but stories about them are exaggerated. I think the vast majority of QAnon advocates are lawful, patriotic American citizens. It is a cult. I think the people who believe him/her have been led astray by their own desire to receive validation of their already extremist views. Then they get fed misinformation and lies on channels like OAN/Fox News/Newsmax that leads them further astray. It's a dangerous feedback loop of misinformation that culminated in an insurrection and threatened our democracy. I think QAnon is quite silly. I think they're dangerous but that their danger is dwindling. Because more people are getting bored of it. Given the bizarre extreme black propaganda going on right now, I don't doubt that something is going on that we aren't being told. People don't get upset about things like Dr. Seuss for no reason. There's some truth to the conspiricies, I think. No real thoughts They seem like a bunch of earnest but very ill-informed people, misled by clever others who tap into their innate paranoia, feelings of disenfranchisement, and racism.  In short, they are fools who believe fantastical stories told to them by gifted manipulators like Trump It scares me because it preys on the ignorant and makes them believe things that are actually against their best interest; it causes a;ready aggressive people to become extremely militant and dangerous to society. small group of conspiricy figures better known by media and democrats than by conservatives or republicans which are used to try to instill fear I don't have much to say about Qanon. I need to search more about it. It is a group espousing false claims about everything and its membership are mainly lonely and angry working-class men who have been screwed over by government and corporate greed and power-seeking. They are potentially dangerous. The group needs to be watched closedly by he FBI and NGA groups that monitor racists and anti-semite groups. I have no thoughts or feelings. I feel sorry for the people that are that stupid to believe any of QAnon's pronouncements Qanon itself isn't very dangerous, it's not much different from any other conspiracy, but the cult-like mentality of people that follow it could be a serious threat I have very little knowledge about QAnon therefore, I don't have any real thoughts or feelings regarding anything relating to QAnon. I think they're incredibly dangerous. I don't understand how people can believe things like that. I have no idea what this is. I believe if they were a part of instigating the riots at the Capital then they are a very dangerous group. I think it is overrated, created / devised to create a diversion from more substantial events. We never truly know all of what Our Government is doing or what agendas are on the horizon. It's a dangerous and alarming phenomenon and disconcerting that any reasonable person would believe any of it. But somehow and sadly I'm not surprised. People believe in ghosts, Bigfoot and other such things.  And there are people that believe  the earth is flat QAnon may or may not be a threat to American security and to be on the safe side their activities need to be monitored.  I don't think that there level of threat is very high, but just to be sure that there are no negative consequences of their actions, the government needs to keep an eye on them. It is a very illogical organization. Our country doesn't need this type of anti-democratic groups. A 4Chan /POL/ joke making fun of conspiracy theories that insane people latched onto to confirm their misguided beliefs and that Right Wing Groups/Conservatives use to push their increasingly fascist policies that benefit the wealthy elites and divide the lower classes further. In addition the fact that large online media pushes the content due to revenue they gain makes it very harmful and will likely destroy Western Democracies as more disasters such as Climate Change continue to occur and xenophobia from this mass immigration from environmental disasters will lead to the rise of Fascism and Nationalism in the West as China becomes the dominant global power. Crazy, unethical, cult that believes in the falsehoods of Donald Trump.  None of their information they spew is reliable. I think they don't exist..i only heard them when the capitol incident happened They're deranged maniacs who pose a huge danger to the country. They believe things that have no basis in evidence and are immune to reason and logic. They are scary. It's really amazing the garbage people will believe when someone tells them it's a secret conspiracy.  All of the QAnon stories contradict one another, none of them are remotely believable, and the trolls who invented them out of whole cloth have confessed (and laughed at the believers about it), and yet they still believe this crap. I feel that it is ridiculous that some people could think like that. I think anyone who believes even a single thing coming from them is too stupid to be allowed any influence in society and should be laughed out of any serious conversation for the rest of their lives. I think it is something made up. I think that a higher percentage of the population that are ""gun nuts""  are also QAnon nuts.  They are very gullible and were well-represented during the attempted coup (which is what it was).  I want these folks to go play with their ATVs and not their guns.  I believe QAnon will eventually wither  and die, but am concerned about what other dangerous cults will emerge. None I don't think QAnon is very effective for american security. i dont think about them. they just seem like quacks. I had to look it up. I think it sounds ridiculous. I think QAnon are a group of dangerous and terribly misguided individuals who can do a lot of harm to this country. I'm undecided as to whether they are mentally insane or not but their access to powerful places need to be limited. They are believer of false claims I think it is a group of people who have some serious mental issues.  They are dangerous to others and have extreme ideas and thoughts and need to be controlled. The people who believe in those conspiracy theories are idiots. It shows how easily manipulated they are. I think it is unfortunate that a group like this gets any publicity or recognition. I don't believe QAnon is popular in any significant way, but is used as a talking point to further divide the country. Very stupid. QAnon is a far-right conspiracy group that needs to be stopped. I consider them to be a domestic terrorist group but I am not sure if that is how the FBI categorizes QAnon. At a minimum, QAnon should be considered to be a cult. I don't know what QAnon is so I don't have a strong feelings about it. Misguided and foolish Very dangerous conspiracy theories they have Ridiculous lies that have brainwashed idiots. They believe in conspiracies at all levels of American society and they are a threat to our representative democracy. Trump's cult idk ,i feel they caused alot of miss information ,caused people to listen to dumb conspiracies with nothing to face check or back it up I don't like it, anything having to do with any other entity besides God himself is false doctrination.  People are inviting evil into their lives and far from what this country was founded upon.  This is a disgrace It is a quite far-fetched extremist theorist group that has a very large online prescence. I feel that I never know it all.My thoughts about QAnon is nutrual i'm not sure what is the truth. They believed Trump is the legitimate president of the United States balderdash innovation A waste of time. It's nonsense promoted by the media to create drama. Drama keeps people watching. People watching drives advertising. I don't know much about them, except they seem to be very ignorant, uneducated, misinformed and dangerous. I long ago gave up trying to reason with crazy or stupid, so my philosophy is to avoid them whenever possible. ? They are a bunch of nut balls. I try NOT to think about those nutcases. I think they're anti American crackpots. These conspiracy theorists believe in and follow someone who is anonymous. They don't even know who they blindly follow. They are crazy people being manipulated by the Russian government or by people who want to feed their paranoia. I thought it was interesting at first but there has been a lot of propaganda and conversation against it so I think it isn't true now. Hard to know what is real or fake nowadays Dangerous I really don???t understand it They are a terrorist group trying to influence the government and the population. I think QAnon is disgraceful. I do not believe in its ideals. I think it should be shut down. It is an absurd cult of ignorant people that have been brainwashed into right wing extremism. It should have no place in modern society. QAnon is dangerous. ""Q"" is fictitious but the people that believe that nonsense will stop at nothing to force an outcome they desire. The threat to American security stems from their instability and willingness to infiltrate the government. Bottomless rabbit hole for those with addictive personalities looking for an addiction I think it is completely stupid, ridiculous, and made up. I think it's a ridiculous and harmful cult that preys on people by validating their biases and their need to belong. They're a bunch of conspirators who want to watch the world burn. I don't want to make any comments on this subject. I do not think that any truth should be kept from the public Never heard of it I do not know much about QAnon so cannot really say either way. It is a dangerous conspiracy group that seems prone to violence It is a cult like following of extremists I don't know what QAnon is exactly. QAnon is dangerous and crazy. I don't know much about QANON and choose not to go down that rabbit hole. I don't have time for that. No different than BLM and Antifa.  Actually, they're better. I dont know want that is They are crazy I am extremely disturbed by the prevalence of QAnon in today's society. It's genuinely frightening to me that people actually believe the things that make up the tenets of QAnon, and I am uncertain that there is any real way to prevent QAnon or other such ""fringe"" groups from gaining more traction and becoming harder to defeat. I do not listen to them because they lie. I doubt QAnon exists. they are racist and self absorb I think waning is dimetii hi g that needs to be on our governments radar, To make sure we will be ok and they r not underestimated on what could happen. I think conspiracy theories can have profound negative effect on modern society. It makes me fear for people's safety. a crackpot conspiracy theory propagated by people fascinated by such stories.  It is more for entertainment than anything. traitorous miscreants. They are causing trouble for the sake of causing trouble. They are the worst the internet has to offer. How people listen to them and give them any credence whatsoever is beyond me. I have no clue about QAnon. QAnon is a community full of uneducated bigots, who cry at misinformation whenever something does not align with their agenda. Their whole community started as a joke on a shitpost website, and began to be taken seriously by easily influenced people who do not bother looking up actual facts, and rather look for bits of information that match their own agenda, when the full picture would demonstrate otherwise. 1. It does't exist.  2.  The phenomena of people believing made up stories is powerful and destabilizing to the country. Any far poltical group who tries to divide people is a threat to America's wellbeing. I have just heard of it, and that it is an unknown force to be reckoned with. QAnon is disgusting and idiotic Some crazy people who think that other people drink blood what is it An organization with the theory that Trump will save the world. I don't know much or follow news about QAnon. From early mention of QAnon last year I figured it was a fringe group with outlandish beliefs. So I decided it is not worth my time to follow. Q is a troll, and the people who believe it are fools. It is a group of people that spread LIES, and get other Weak people to believe in them. I feel this man is acting as the devil's advocate. I sincerely feel sorry for this man. I have NO idea why a QAnon person is in the Senate (or house, I forget which). I think QAnon is misinformed, to put it kindly, and I think they are a threat to our government. These are idiotic individuals who just want to cause trouble. it scares the hell out of me, and seems like a very dangerous cult mentality It's an unfounded right-wing conspiracy theory. I don't know what it is so have no thoughts or feelings I don't know a whole lot about QAnon other than it's a conspiracy group.  I don't believe in what they believe. It is a cynical creation made to stir up discontent and make money Dont know much about it Don't know much about them It is extremely unfortunate that so many people have allowed themselves to be duped by this organization's platform.  People have a right to believe what they want; they do NOT have a right to act out in a manner that harms others, regardless of the harm that form takes.  If Qanon promotes destruction of any part of this country's authority, those who participate should be tried and convicted. I have no idea what QAnon is It is nonsense.  I am surprised at how many people believe it. it is made up of people who need something to believe in.  it has become a cult. My next door neighbor, a bright and articulate man with whom i used to teach high school has bought into the Q-Anon alternative universe. It terrifies me in that if he can be brainwashed, i think almost anyone can. Jan 6th inflicted a worse calamity on this country as 9-11  - I can't understand how anyone believes this - which bothers me to a great extent. Same with the Anti-Vaxx movement...it undermines the entire country - and Q-Anon is even more dangerous I think it is a destructive fad made possible by the current state of the internet and some people's tendency to troll and attempt to get attention. I think the internet will evolve and eventually we will have some way for people to establish the credibility of what they read online. Sounds like a myth to me. I have neither negative nor positive thoughts and feelings about QAnon. I heard of them a number of times from news and other outlets, but don't know too much about their inner workings. I think it is somewhat good however, that people can come together in what they believe in, which I believe QAnon believes that there's a large plot against Donald Trump. Domestic terrorists. They are trying to undermine our government and recruit members the way other terrorist cell do.,. The followers of QAnon are delusional and insane. Q is not steve bannon. I believe some of the things Qanon say A bunch of idiots. Easily led. No thought process. Believe anything they are told if it matches their mood. I think they are mostly harmless except for a few members who take it into real life. They sound like a bunch of flakes, with a bunch of idiot ideas. They are here to destroy. They are extremists. They are domestic terrorists. I think it is a black magic.Which perfroms for special need. I know their are a lot of conspiracy theories but I don't weigh in on too much information on topics. It is a dangerous organization that promotes baseless conspiracy theories. I think that the idea of QAnon is ridiculous. The idea does not make sense to me. I'm not too big into politics because of some other problems, but I think that it is pretty dumb and just egging people on with their silliness I think it kept a lot of conservatives passive in the belief that there was a 'plan' in place to ensure Donald Trump's return to the Presidency. I feel QAnon is a dangerous organization full of conspiracy theorists and racists who want to be in charge of our world. They should be watched carefully and charged if they are found to be inciting any harmful events in our country. people who are not deep thinkers and want to believe crazy shit have found their people online and are going full batshit THEY ARE STUPID It's frustrating that so many Americans have bought into crazy conspiracy theory BS. They stormed the capital, but nothing has really happened except some dude getting organic food in jail. It's not being taken seriously enough. I mean, they believe in lizard people but want to kill senators. I am furious that people are so gullible and ignorant, and think there is a special place in hell for those who propagate such nonsense. lunatics The Terrace at lower than United States at some point in time I'm going to try to take us down from with in QAnon is a horrible domestic terrorist group. Politicians need to call them out and disavow them. The government should crack down on these groups for the safety of the country. Their conspiracy theories are blatantly false They are stupid morons and are a danger to society. The crap they spew is nothing but fear and hate. Entitled far right morons. :) Totally made up nonsense. It scary that people believe this. They're spreading lies and created a cult of scary people. Have no idea I think they are a band of trolls who grew bigger than the joke's leash and now are feeding off the ignorance and superstition of some Americans to spread falsehood QAnon is a hoax made up by people as a joke, but is taken seriously by stupid people. It genuinely concerns me that people are actually dumb enough to believe in it. It's really not good for the country at the right situation. They are a far right organization, highly supportive of Trump. I do not agree with their principles and believe they played a key role in the riots at the capital in January of this year. I think QAnon is largely made up of conservative conspiracy theorists. I think they are cult like and supported Trump. I think now that he is out of office they are losing steam. Don???t know what it of QAnon has essentially become a distribution mechanism for a whole bunch of linked conspiracy theories. Never heard of it. Suppose it is some conspiracy group spreading their version of the truth. Unbelievable that some people would actually fall this! Incredible... It's shocking that this absolutely ridiculous mindset has somehow hit the mainstream. The current republican faction of government promulgates this dangerous propaganda and don't even believe it, yet pretend to support it to hang on to a ""base"" of willfully misinformed, angry people. There is no QAnon. It is a made up scheme by people who do not want truthful information spread by groups of people that have investigated specific topics thoroughly. Again, There is no such thing as ""QAnon"" they are terrorist QAnon doesn't look like a significant threat to the American security Based on the limited information I have it's nothing other than ridiculous I feel like racist white people have been duped into believing this crazy conspiracy because they are scared that minorities are taking over and taking their way of life.  It is dangerous and has been used as a tool for violence. I feel nothing toward this.  It is everyone???s right to believe it or not, or simply ignore it as it has no authority over anything and is simply opinions from anonymous sources. If it resonates with you great if not ignore it.  Fighting this if you disagree with it only gives it more significance Don't know about them I don't really know very much about it apart from they were part of the group that stormed the capital. I thought they believe a lot in conspiracy theories. Dont really know anything about them to be honest I think they are taking conspiracies too far. ",,,,,,,,,,

MotivationTG,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We all wear masks and are fairly risk-averse with regard to being in large crowds. We all have had the vaccine, not been around other people so I thought we were safe to celebrate the way we did. The fact that it's the only way to celebrate Thanksgiving. It's kind of normal. We were all vaccinated and boosted, and had missed celebrating last year. I did not want to risk being exposed to someone who had COVID. Yo be with family. We celebrated this way because everyone was vaccinated. I have gotten diagnosed with cancer since last year and have been through most of the treatment and am in remission. I felt that I deserved to be with the people I love. It was nice to get together with friends again Togetherness kept it private to avoid any chance of getting sick It's how we generally celebrate Thanksgiving every year. It had been too long since we saw one another and took a chance, being that we are all vaccinated and all of us social distance. So so always celebrate thanksgiving that way Always celebrate that way. Avoiding COVID risks. We are ALL vaccinated, some of us ""boostered"". We were all very motivated to celebrate together. We always celebrate this way, and we don't have anyone else to celebrate with. They invited me. We usually invite more people over for Thanksgiving, but we chose to keep it small due to COVID-19. I had nothing else to do. It is enjoyable to gather with family at Thanksgiving and I missed out last year It was easy to do and the best for some of our family. Thanksgiving was also my mother's 81sr birthday, and she has had a rough year as she has lost some mobility due to a broken hip. We wanted to bring her joy. It's what I usually do; no big deal. No one needed feeding. To be with our grandchildre It is a tradition to come together and eat. It is a tradition. I wanted to see my family. To be safe Because we didn't celebrate thanksgiving last year I would rather be with family but feel it isn't safe for evryone so didn't  but I still enjoy the meal even if I can't be with others This is how we celebrate every year. Wanted to be alone. No desire to assume risk of travel. I went with a friend to celebrate the holiday. We were not ready to try and meet with a large group of people. It made sense with where everyone is It's how I always celebrate and everyone (except two minors) was vaccinated and we all live on the same property in different houses so we see each other practically every day anyway. To see family I was invited and this was before omicron, and I had been boosted, so I felt okay with it. I like spending time with my family. We missed our family gathering last year and didn't want to miss it again in 2021. We are mostly safe with our daily practices and almost all vaccinated, so there was not much risk in getting together. It is our custom to make a great feast for 3, watch football and parades and relax. Last year was a virtual Thanksgiving, so I wanted a real Thanksgiving this year since everyone is vaccinated. I need to be with my family I had no where else to go. We had not seen them in 2 years because of Covid. My family wasn't getting together to celebrate. Ease of travel. Tradition My family was there. At home being with  family I live here and we were having Thanksgiving, so I joined in. I didn't invite anyone else over COVID concerns. It was a big family get together with many from out of town. Hunger It is tradition to eat the meal, but I have no family close by My MIL is 95 and I love her It was the easiest and most safe solution. I have no immediate family in this area and my friends are like family We all have been vaccinated and many have received a booster, even my nephews had received at least one shot. Cause this was the decision made by all of us small is safer for now We do this every year we knew everyone was vaccinated We skipped Thanksgiving last year. Now we're all vaccinated and my parents had even gotten boosters at that point. Wanted to send time with my daughter and mother It is a family day We always do it with family. I wanted to celebrate with family since we all were vaccinated and 4 of them already had covid also. It is a family tradition tat we aows do We have all been vaccinated and boosted and I really wanted to celebrate at my home this year. IT IS WHAT WE DO EVERY THANKSGIVING IT IS A TRADITION. I feel like we have had a bad 2 years so I wanted to try yo make Thanksgiving a special one. Though remaining socially distant, I wanted to extend good will toward others on my street. I am thankful, so I celebrated Thanksgiving by giving thanks. to bewith family It's the first time I have been out of my house with family since pandemic started.  I am over with being so fearful of the covid It is a family tradition. I just felt like it was the best thing to do it's actually normal for me We decided not to go to my son's house because there would be too many people present. She's the only family I have left thats what we do a yearly tradition We planned for just us, and that was solidified by illness I am Tsalagi It's a family ritual and we are all healthy We all figured that we are family if one of happens to get sick we all pitch in to help Our daughter is our only close family member, and she had other plans for the day, with friends, so we still wanted to have the traditional meal with each other. We anticipated that a lot of restaurants would be crowded for celebrations so we decided to cook at home and enjoy the moment together. tobewith family and friends Typically how we celebrate.  Shortened and did not play board games to reduce time together. We chose to only allow vaccinated people and did not invite parents or in-laws because they refuse to be vaccinated. I was invited by my brother-in-law's mother and thought it was safe. This is what we always do and there was no reason not to. We were invited It's the halfway point between the two households and neither of us has to do any work Not ready to have any large gathering of friends or family due to Covid This is the way we always celebrate. My father is elderly and it is hard for him to get out so we went to him. We didn't want to cook at home. We also wanted to visit my mother, who lives in a different town with a very low rate of infection. I felt that with everyone as fully vaccinated as could be and showing no symptoms, it was safe enough to do. It is our tradition for all the siblings to get together once a year and have a reunion. because we could its been 2 years since i saw him in person It was important for our family to get together and socialize again after such a crazy year. We hadn't seen them since February 2020. i like football Just happened that way. Everyone in the family was going. I didn't want to be in a large group of people. Tradition. This is how we always celebrated we do not have a lot of family. This is what I would normally do for Thanksgiving and I saw no reason to change anything. It's how I always celebrate. All of us are vaccinated and boosted and everyone is careful to wear masks when around other people in indoor settings. This is what we always do. we always do it this way I like celebrating the holidays with people in person. I hadn't seen these family members since the spring. TIME TO GET TOGETHER AFTER SO LONG I am an introvert, staying home doesnt bother me.  Sister recently had covid didnt want to goto her house.  My mother (70) lives with me wont get vaccinated so I try and keep her home. invitation from friend To see all family members at once. we ended up testing for Covid November 22 Everyone is over it and doing normal things now. Covid is nothing more than the flu for most people. The politicians, corporations, and their controllers are the only ones trying to keep this thing in a persistent state of fear for their own ends. I was looking forward to being in the comfort of my own home without a lot of people coming over. She would have been alone otherwise and we felt safe together. I wanted to keep it simple and small. It is a family tradition. It is beyond time to return to normal life. It's what has always been done. I wanted to spend time with family, but still do so safely. Safety and common sense I did not want to socialize with anyone because of the high rate of Covid cases in my state. annual celebration a neighbor friend was supposed to celebrate with us there I was very happy to celebrate the holiday that way. It's a long and traditional heritage to celebrate the thanksgiving in our family. It's good food without all the Hassel of cooking it. We wanted to stay safe and keep family members safe. My parents otherwise I despise the holiday. We go every year except last year we always do I celebrated it this way because I wont let Covid alter my life. Always. I love Thanksgiving I like doing small get togethers. Nobody We always do it every year except last year. Tradition and done this way every year. i love the holidays family tradition This is how I always celebrate Thanksgiving. To get together and see family. Because it's something we've always done and it makes us happy. my family Quite. I enjoy seeing friends during the holidays that I don't see much otherwise. That everyone agree to follow the rules. This is what we do. We were all vaccinated and wanted to see each other. We have an elderly family member and it has been too long. Wanted to have just a few people. We are seniors high risk. Family members are not reliable to test just before gatherings. There is no need to be afraid. I wanted to spend some time with my friends on a special occasion. DIDN'T FEEL LIKE TRAVELING AND BEING EXPOSED TO THE VIRUS Well, we thought about eating out at a restaurant for Thanksgiving, but since my mom is very elderly, has not had a booster shot and is not moving around so well this year, we decided to stay home. I felt like we needed something and since we were both alone for weeks before I knew it was safe. for family i live with to feel like its a normal year We do every year, why not? We always have small celebrations in general. We were all vaxed or tested. It is what we do every year. How we always do it Tradition Covid concerns made most of the local family decide to celebrate alone instead of gathering. How not celebrated Thanksgiving with my children in a year covid ended all thoughts of a bigger dinner My wife and I are at high risk because of health issues and we just wanted to avoid other people. Because that's how we do it. We haven't seen them in a year and we have all been vaccinated and received the booster, so we went to a place where it would be just ""us"". It's what we always do Fellowship with family My parents wanted to come so they didn't have to cook, and my partner's brother did as well. My husband and I love spending some holidays alone I want to support my sister and her husband. This is how we usually celebrate Thanksgiving I live with my mother who is 89 and I wanted to make a nice day even though she was staying in I had a short break so it was easier for them to travel to me We were all vaccinated so I thought it would be safe to get together we all felt safe being vaccinated and having a booster shot Celebrated just like any other year. It is what we always do. To come together with family and friends comforting, lovely way to spend time Try to have normality My celebration of Thanksgiving remained the same as last year's. Safe because everyone had there covid shots We've always spent Thanksgiving with my parents. It is how we traditionally celebrate the holiday every year. Everyone was vaccinated. Tradition It's what we always do on Thanksgiving since most other family doesn't visit on the exact day and trickles in over the week to say hello. We get together almost every year. It's our family tradition. It's the way we always have done it. I do not want to get COVID. We thought that with the virus, and with other extended members not vaccinated, it was only safe to do this. I see no problem with celebrating since nothing is wrong with anyone I know. It was a tradition prior to Covid. All but the two youngest were fully vaxxed and boosted. covid  and other family far away  not my usual before covid All members in our household and my family as well had already taken the vaccine. To stay safe from contracting Covid-19 because going out is impossible as I currently (not for long) live in Florida with no safety protocols in place and a high percentage of morons. do it every year Its a family tradition It was the safest way to celebrate. usual way It is nicer to be at home and not have guests. It is tradition. Thanksgiving is a family tradition. I enjoy being with my friends when we can all be together at the same time. We always do this every year. Very! This elderly lady is like a mother to me after losing my mom and being with a best friend and good cook which I am not : ) We are all vaccinated and sick of COVID and not willing to put life on hold any longer. i was invited and my spouse was out of town so I wouldn't be alone Still social distancing but wanted typical food for the season. It is something I enjoy doing and celebrating the tradition. COVID-19 vaccine. Just an intense desire to stick it to liberals, amirite? j/k - because everyone is vaxed and nobody worried about stuff we can't control. #GodsPlan we always do I did not want to go out and wanted to cook at home. Delayed family Thanksgiving get-together until the weekend after. It has been  a long time since covid and the cases are going down. We haven't seen my parents in two years (due to COVID). Wanted to take a vacation. I wanted to stay safe while enjoying the holiday. just spend time together We had not been down to see my daughter at her house since December 2019. We did not celebrate together last year, we have always celebrate it together. All of us are vaccinated and three have had boosters as well. I felt comfortable having my immediate family over for dinner and interacting indoors and without masks. we don't have any other family that lives nearby it's complicated, lots of out of state folks we chose to keep it small always do We wanted to be together. My partner likes it and so do I Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday and this is the way we traditionally celebrate. Easier to coordinate. We live far away from other family, and travelling was not worth the risk and time. These family members and I lived together for the first 3 months of COVID-19 and spend holidays together as well as other times. I always do, and everyone was vaccinated. We hadn't seen each other in a long time and wanted to get the family together again. It was just the two of us so we wanted to get together and watch a Christmas movie. This is what we do every year so this is a tradition. Both of our siblings and their children are not vaccinated so we decide we would only gather with those who were vaccinated. We are all fully vaccinated and we want to get back to normal a little bit. I wanted to make memories with loved ones. I haven?t seen many of them in a year and decided to live life. To enjoy a traditional Thanksgiving meal. its normal Because of COVID. We always do Thanksgiving this way; rarely do we do anything with more of the family, I only went for the food. Spending time with family. I knew we were all vaccinated and very careful. It felt safer to have a small gathering with all members who were vaccinated. To much time alone My inlaws and aunt are elderly and didn't have anyone else to celebrate Thanksgiving with, so I fixed a nice, traditional Thanksgiving meal for them. it was close We enjoyed a quiet dinner together as I had to fly out to Arizona the next day. it was after long time we gathered and wanted to enjoy This may be the last time we are able to celebrate Thanksgiving together. traditions We did not get together with our normal larger group of 30-40 people. Tradition dictates it Same as how we always spend it. Worried about Thanksgiving because one of my daughters is pregnant. Because did not want to travel It's a tradition. WE do it every year that we are able. It's tradition Spending time with the family Family had other plans. Our other family members and friends were traveling elsewhere while we stayed home. Why not? To be together with family and not leave my father's partner alone after he passed this summer. Too many relative aren't catious about Covid. To stay safe Being together with family To see my daughter Family and community are vaccinated It is how we celebrate it every year, COVID does not make us change our behaviors We always celebrate Thanksgiving just the two of us. covid My wife and I have no local family and wildly different dietary needs, so going out to celebrate makes sense for us. Just a small way to feel a bit positivity during the holiday. This is how we always celebrate Thnksgiving. too risky to have more people or unvaxxed people This was a safe and easy way to celebrate with my closest family members. It is how we normally celebrate and I didn't feel to nervous. I was very motivatedf Same as previous year It is the one day out of the year I can be unhealthy. Meeting with family and friends. We wanted to get together this year dont care about covid anymore tradition seeing my family and getting a break from school We didn't do it the year before and we were vaccinated so we did it. Covit fightet nothing It is what we do every year. I do it every year and we enjoy a lot. vaccinated and boosted It's extremely important to my mom. It's been a while since my family has gathered together, so we decided to meet this year because we've all been vacinated and were feeling healthy. We keep it small to be safe. because it is tradition I hadnt visited my family in 2 years. that is how I always do it It was normally how we celebrated. ",,,

Something I can't contrl 24 hours in a day.  365 days in a year. third dimensional monitor of events, continuum. It feels like it moves very fast, because very little changes. I measure time almost in a seasonal sense, and how fast each one passes.  Like, the Christmas season, or the back to school or summer season.  Not so much in terms of months or days, but honestly, seasons. Time seems to be passing a little faster than normal in the short-term. A month feels closer than it used to. variable, Sometimes it seems like time is dragging on and at other times as if it's flying by. It's passing by at a normal rate. Time is a means to measure the passage of our days. Time allows us to figure out how long something happened in the past or will happen in the future Something that I can use to determine what is going on in life and that I can use as a marker for my life. Time is the measurement of the passing of moments. moving quickly as in a day moves faster as I get older It feels that time is passing fast. it's a measurement of some kind How each moment moves into the next one The way we measure the succession of events on earth. Time flies when you're having fun. Time man made to measure stuff moving too fast minutes passing by Time is the medium that life and the universe moves through. Things can only flow in one direction through time. its moving at a steady pace at the moment inevitable Minutes hiurs days years and how i spend it as I get older my perception of time is a blur and each day blends into the next as time literally seems to fly by The passage of minutes, hours, days, weeks and years. The continuum of events and experience through the regular cycle of days, months, and years. Time is hard to define; it is used to describe the events/happenings that occur sequentially. A property of matter similar to space that living creatures interpret rather illusionarily as moving forward due to the way cause always precedes effect making it so that memories are physically unidirectional. I would describe time as an ongoing sequence of events that occur, past, present and future The hours of the day and the days of the month and the months of the year. It seems like it goes by much faster since March 2020 than before it. Time is moving so fast. I can't believe 2 years have past since the pandemic started. It moves quickly and waits for no one. moving right along Time feels almost like it is standing still. It's not that the days seem long because they don't it's more that I feel like this period of time is all by itself. Like it is seperate from real life time. If that makes any sense. I think that when or if this pandemic is all over with then time will go back to normal life time. It's as if this is a break frim real life or something. The order of things that happen or need to happen. it seems to be escaping me with months going by so fast and 6 months is so close now human measure of change Time is a dimension where events happen in the past, present, and future. Feels fsst in the longrun and slow short term fast It marches on There's both too much and not enough. Time is a continuum of minutes, hours, days, months, and years.  We measure lives based on time. Time is a sequence of events from the past, to present, and to the future.  There are different measures of time, that can be used. slow moving Moves to fast fleeting and limited flowing never enough of it Not sure what you mean here? It's become more homogenous. I live alone and do not do much so time is just a matter of what each day brings. I HAVE NO RECOLECTION OF TIME ANYMORE ,TIME IS MOVING QUICKLY THESE DAYS Open ended continuum going by as same as usual TIME IS THE PASSING OF EVENTS IN YOU LIFE FOR A DAY, A YEAR, A DECADE YOU WHOLE LIFE. something man made up so he will have something to keep track of. A measurement used to track length Time keeps moving and we need to make the most of it. We dont get the two years that were stolen from us added back ever so make the most of what is left. the progression of events past or present a measurement of the passing of life that is consistent in speed, yet perceived to happen at different speeds by those conscious of it It's always the present time, but we can remember the past and think about the future. no idea increments of events Life is whizzing by The hours, days and weeks we count to keep up with our lives. A continuum connected the past, present, and future. It is measured by what you accomplish continuous Time is the way you experiences the day. Sometimes it goes quick and other times faster depending on what is going on. very fleeting and very precious. It seems to go by quicker literally day by day. Time is how long it takes from one even to another - the sooner or most recent the event, the shorter the time is. We count it in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years and our total existence here on earth. A repition of routine fleeting day to day change kills you Time is generally annoying and unstable. It passes very quickly when one is enjoying itself, and very slowly when one is not. I am holding on to some vague hope it is just another co-ordinate ( like, X, or Y, Or Z) and some smart kid, will figure out how to plot it on a map. Then, perhaps I can get the time machine I so desire before I die.( I'm sure I am not the only  person who wants such a machine :) looking back on what I have done over the past year Hard for me to describe. I'm 72, it just passes and I'm grateful for it being there. I would describe time in terms of projects that need to be done and the timelines to get them done. fleeting too fast The sense of movement through life marked by milestones. Time seems to be passing more quickly these days.  Maybe because more things are opening up and things are sort of going back to normal. something that takes you to a different set of events Time is the only thing I personally own and it is mine to gift as I see fit. hours days weeks months The passage of hours and minutes, I guess. There's cosmic time and there's human time . I tend to think in terms of cosmic time . Human time is an artificial construct  made up by our minds . balanced A way to manage days. Relentless? It really flies by, especially as you get older. Time is just day to day passage of our lives. Each day you have is a special time that will never come again. the passage of life it the measure of how long it takes as i progress through life Not possible to describe. day to day week to week and so on conceptual to what is happening around me Time is the passing of seconds, minutes hours, days, weeks, months, and years. Time is a span of our life that goes by at a relative pace. Time is the steady march of moments toward the eventual goal of death. The minutes and hours of my life linier just world turning space of moments as the years go by Barley there. From sunrise to sunset. Variable, inescapable, consuming It passes too quickly and there is never enough of it!  I was talking to my 16 year old daughter and even she said that when she was younger and even now, time passes very quickly for her.  That makes me feel sad because time passed very slowly for me when I was her age.  I am not sure why it makes my sad.  Maybe because i think of things like summer vacation, which dragged by for me and seemed to last forever, and I know that it flies for her. An empty space to be filled as productivley as possible, but with few possibilities. Times have changed, and will continue to change highly subjective Existence one day going into the next day Time is a measurement of activity.  Space and time go together. The way we measure hours, days, weeks months and years. Time is used to quantify, measure or compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and even, sequence events. Time is the length of a measure that says how long something took Time passes comfortably slowly. Mostly not a conscious concern. I don't know, I wouldn't decribe time to someone. Time is moving fast passing Feels like it is passing slowly until you realize another week,month or year has passed by in the blink of an eye fleeting a tool to be used to schedule all events Fleeting and goes by too quickly Something that is happening whether we like it or not. Sometimes it seems fast, other times it seems slow. A series of hours or events over 24 hours per day. I try to live in the moment. Time is a measurement used to make certain that most people are on the same page as far as life in general.  (sleep, work, appointments, seasons, years etc) goes by slow slow in the short term but fast in the long term something which eats my life away; & it's eating faster & faster / very long time of pandemic, contrary to what we thought. It hasn't changed much for me -- it just flows onward at a steady pace. going faster all the time faster then ever before I'm not sure how to answer this but since the pandemic set in, I have experienced time passing very fast. A flowing river, changing from one second to the next. One day meshing into the next due to lack of stimulation and safe activities. Just one long stretch of time with little differention of activities. Time is moving at a steady pace to me, neither too quickly nor too slowly. Time is a measurement of when events take place. hours and days that go by I wish it would slow down ongoing Time has slowed because of health issues linear a measurement designed by humans for keeping order on the planet Time goes faster the older I get regardless of outside circumstances. It seems to go faster when I am having fun. It is what happens between Wordles. Regular A way of measuring specific conditions at a specific moment in history, whatever that means to you There's never enough of it As the days run into months with nothing to do, the slow days turn into fast months. it feels slower I feel like my life is almost over. the rate of how things change How long it takes for a month to pass.  For me winter months pass more slowly than summer months. constantly looking at the calander A man made construct for the 4th dimension. It is a construct of the mind based on our feelings Passage of events that stay in your memory. The more events, the longer time seems. it goes by quickly perception of changes both within and without Passes faster the older I get For this question the perception of how much time has passed How humans keep track of the days, weeks, hours, minutes and seconds. It's going to keep us moving forward whether we like it or not. how quickly say like a week/couple of days  goes by Moving towards a conclision As completion of task and mostly work. its a precious commodity that will be missed if it leaves you Time has passed differently (slower) since covid for me personally Endless Time moves quickly in my life.  Days go by fast. Sense of speed in time. Going on the same as always. It is constant sometimes slow, sometimes fast, a long time since March 2020 The measured passage of events. I haven't been affected negatively by Covid at all, so time is passing more quickly now because I'm older. But it's basically the same as always. It feels faster with each decade I move in to. Time is starting to pick back up It's a subjective experience of a series of events. a measurment of how we experience to passage of our lives as it moves forward and we get older Time is  the progression of events from the past to the present into the future. Time seems to pass more slowly when I'm not involved in activities that I love and are captivating my mind and spirit. When I'm not doing those things time passes more slowly. Time is the measurement of events, dates, etc. in minutes moving fast Recently, it seems to be going quite quickly. Time is perceptual, in that it varies according to what activity is happening and the state of mind that I am in.  The now is all we really have. Time goes by rapidly. Past, present, future Time is the perceived duration that an individual experiences that is either close or far from physical time or the same as physical time. Quick continually moving towards something we won't know until we get there the available period in which to accomplish something cyclical, repetitive, ever-present I would describe it as fast at times and slow at other times depending on what's going on in my life meaningless Personally, I would describe it as fluid.  In general, I would define it as a measurement of the number of nanoseconds, seconds, minutes etc. that have occurred over a specific timeframe.. The infinite continued progress of existence and event in the past present and future regarded as a whole. It's going very fast man made construct to bookmark moments flying by Months and years seem longer, days and weeks fly by. Time would be the feeling of how quickly a day, month or year takes to go by. moving slowly Wasted. The ongoing change that occurs in life. Time is the passage of events the changng of seasons, the birth and passing of people moving quickly now as everything is winding down, school etc I have patterns of events that influence how I see time.  So I am tuned in to the passage of time in a positive way. flies I would describe it as the passing of minutes, days, weeks, months, and years as we move through a cycle of events. It doesn't wait, do what you have to do and stop procrastinating goes by to fast the same fleeting Measure of entropy?  Imperfect human perception of space-time?? I don't know: nobody has been able to describe or define time to my satisfaction. one day at a time passing too quickly time passes slower since the pandemic. how quickly we seem to move from one day or week to the next like the adage says -  appears faster as you get older.  So watch out, young 'uns The last few years have gone by in a blur during the pandemic. Everything is moving quickly. It goes at its own pace. I am along for the ride. I would define time as the progression of reality toward the future, reflecting in ever-changing conditions. If you mean describe how time has been feeling to me lately, I would say it's seemed a bit faster than usual, particularly within the last six months. It's been hard to focus on the present. I suppose I think of it as in how old I am now. Space that passes I became a parent in 2017, so this is a fdifficult question to answer, since in general, time seems to pass more quickly for me now. But I do feel that the last two years have passed so fast and slow at the same time. I can't believe how much my youngest child has been cheated out of seeing extended family members, in some cases, grandparents who barely know her. Time is passing normally. fluid time is a construct and i don't like talking about it Slow, mundane, and boring. fast time is fast when we are think about the past but slow when we are thinking about the future events that occur in the past, present and future the duration of something A linear progression that is constant but can be perceived to pass at different rates. Time is a continual march forward The linear progression of the expansion of the universe. Going by faster than before COVID.  The days and weeks are flying by. It is the most valuable currency spent carelessly same as always Since not working I keep busy but I do so many things the same everyday Time is a precious moment that is measured in hours and minutes. a slow sameness time is a manmade constraint As an active retired person, time to me seems quite normal - not too different than when I was working. Something that reminds me to do certain things every day it is too long suffering from Covid 19 same as it has always been it's on steroids....and it keeps accelerating I think I would describe as the simple progression of events from past to present to future. I would describe time as flying by. I would describe it as something nobody seems to be able to control. it is relative. Time is moving at a normal pace for me. time is something you can't get back once it is gone it is gone A failed mechanism for keeping everything from happening at once. Fleeting infinitely fast Steady as usual The past seems like it only just happened, but the future seems far away. Time is passing by relatively quick currently. Time is the unit of measure we use to determine the distance between events. The perception of time is definitely dependent on the events of ones' life and what is happening in the world. in short supply, make the most of it not real The past, present, and future There's only enough time and one day and it seems to be accelerating it seems to pass quicker as I get older Flies Like a river that flows differently depending on what's going on in my life. the passing of events Time is wait for non. Moving faster as I get older slow AN ILLUSION How long something takes or specifying when something will happen. 2 Fleeting Suddenly it's gone without my noticing it A unit of measurement that determines the biological patterns of existence. Time moves fast at times, but at other times it moves almost depressingly slow.  It's kind of a toss up. It is moving so fast. I would describe time as the duration that has passed ",,
