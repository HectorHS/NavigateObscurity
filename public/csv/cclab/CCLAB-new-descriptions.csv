NewPandemic1,"Imagine the following scenario: A deadly new virus is found to have emerged from a wild animal population and is now spreading among people in Australia. Scientists confirm that it is highly contagious and that infections are fatal in the great majority of cases; as a consequence, if it is not stopped, within a year the virus would effectively destroy all human life. Experts determine that if humanity pools its resources and contributes a great deal of labor to creating new biotechnology, we might be able to develop an effective vaccine within a year before the virus spreads out of control, though the experts cannot tell how likely this effort is to succeed. But there is a catch. Because global transportation and shipping will have to be completely shut down and all of our efforts will be dedicated to developing the new technology, things on Earth will get worse until the struggle is over. Jobs will be switched to essential work, lockdowns and shortages of food and goods will be widespread, and no resources will be available for humanitarian efforts, entertainment, or non-emergency healthcare.
