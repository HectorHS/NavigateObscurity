1,1,"Heboric was a thief who became a priest of Fener and then a historian. He is covered in the boar's tattoos and has stumps for hands. He wrote a revised history of the Malazan Empire arguing that the Empress was a murderer, and a failed one at that. He was trialled, with Duiker coming to his defence, but was nonetheless convicted and ended up in chains along with Felisin and Baudin in Unta."
2,1,"A priest of Hood in a mass of flies approaches the chained Heboric to share a secret and swiftly dissipates, flies flying, revealing no one underneath."
3,2,"Heboric develops a theory that otataral was created, rather than naturally occurring. Limestone is sometimes believed to be like the bones of a living thing, and what is crushing, in this case, otataral, something that was once alive. He is reluctant to share the theory as it is apparent that whatever formed it probably entailed a major sorcerous meltdown, and to repeat it shouldn't be encouraged."
4,2,"Felisin is the younger sister of Ganoes Paran, presumed lost in Genabackis, and Tavore Paran, the new Adjunct. She gets imprissoned and ready to be sold as slave following the noble's cull orchestrated by her own sister."
5,2,"Due to a nobility cull in Unta, nobles were dragged from their homes at night, trialed in a mock of justice and chained in the morning to be taken as slaves. Mobs in the city joined in to punish the survivors. The Empress, with a single blow, made dissidents disappear, apeased the mobs, and made a case for more recruits / military presence in the capital (due to the mobs), paying them by ceising assets from the nobility. Tavore Paran, the new Adjunct, was the orchestrator of the move, and also overviews the process with T'amber always on her side, and a group of Red Blades nearby. All this was seen through the point of view of Heboric. Presumably, the cull is meant to set an example for the rest of the Empire, and further violence from the mob while prisoners are moved to the slave ships is to be expected, and even encouraged. The ensuing violence avoided Heboric due to his obvious alignment to Fener (tattoos), and Baudin due to his brutality, climaxing to his killing of a nearby noble (by sawing off her head) as payment for passege in the gathering mob. Felisin survived the passage simply by being chained between Heboric and Baudin."
6,3,"Mappo and Icarium happen to travel near the Path of Hands, and Icarium hopes that through this convergence and the possible opening of a gate, he will get some answers in search of his past. The duo come upon Rhyllandaras (a D'ivers) in the form of 6 dessert wolves who, however, avoids them after recognising them."
7,4,"Duiker is the imperial historian who happens to be in Hissar for his own research when Coltaine arrives to take command as the new Fist of the 7th army, to help control the expected rebelious insurrection. Coltaine was the leader of the Wickan clans against the Emperor, and following his defeat was somehow turned around and vowed allegiance to the old Emperor. Duiker judges him to be one of the few remaining able commanders in the empire after Dujek got outlawed and Lorn killed. Nevertheless he questions his ability to stay in command having stayed away from the Empire's politics for so long. Furthermore, the 7th army is filled with veterans who fought against the Wickans back in the day, and the very arrival of the Wickans results in an uproar in both sides, one however, that gets swiftly settled by Coltaine himself and his absolute control of his warriors. Duiker is looking forward to meeting him."
8,5,"Kalam, Fiddler, Crokus and Apsalar are traveling incognito, arriving in Seven Cities. They are supposed to be returning Apsalar back home with Crokus tagging in for the ride. Crokus questions why they needed to pass through this continent instead of heading straight to Quon Tali, Apsalar's home. Kalam announces he is going to try to assassinate Empress Lassen, with Quick Ben being his shaved knuckle in the hole, and to do that they need to pass through Seven Cities which also happens to be in the verge of rebellion."
9,4,"We learn that Kalam used to be a Falah'dan assassin, who upon switching sides was given a hand of Claws to command. A master assassin according to Apsalar. We also learn that he took the role of a local guide to lead Whiskeyjack's troop in pursuit of Quick Ben while secretly plotting with the wizard, but Whiskeyjack somehow knew. Apsalar seems to have retained some knowledge or memories from the god that possessed her."
10,4,"Fiddler, Kalam, Crokus and Apsalar cross paths with a soletaken dhenrabi who wanted them dead for witnessing his passage. Fiddler throws him a munition securing their safe passage."
11,4,"Duiker and Sormo E'nath witness a conjuring of a Seer and a cripple. The manifestation involves Dryjhna, the promise of Apocalypse, and two women of the same blood feeding each other in ignorance."
12,7,"Duiker meets Coltaine, Bult (Coltaine's uncle and second in command) , Mallick Rel, Kulp (the last remaining cadre mage of the seventh) and Sormo E'nath (Coltaine's top Wickan warlock) on their first official meeting where we learn that Bult almost killed Duiker in the past, getting a nasty scar in the face from Dujek in response, while Bult's horse bit Dujek's arm (resulting in losing the limp). Mallick Rel passes the order from High Fist Promqual for the 7th to march to Aren for inspection, as well as for the fleet (led by Admiral Nok) to do the same. Bult (so that Coltaine avoids a direct conflict) treats him as a message boy, states the orders are not sound tactically, proposes a change of plans and dismisses Mallick until there is a response from Promqual. Duiker explains that despite not having oficial authority, Mallick is the main governing authority in the area (top dog of a collection of merchants who have been ruling the continent even before Promqual took over 4 years ago), that by dismissing him they made him an enemy, and his enemies tend to disappear. Coltaine asks Duiker to investigate Mallick, Duiker hesitates and so Coltaine decides to keep Duiker close instead."
13,7,"We learn from Bult that although Lassen ordered the execution of all Wickan warlocks, crows collected their spirits and powers and brought them to youths for the warlocks to be reborn. 11 crows carried the spirit of Sormo, the greatest warlock, into this kid who is about ten years old. Kulp confirms his power is one of an elder powerful warlock."
14,7,"We learn that a lot of the old guard (Cartheron Crust, Urko, Toc the Elder, Ameron) have reportedly drowned without their bodies ever been found. Bult makes an argument that although some might assume that these disappearances were assasinations by Laseen, in truth it could be the case that Laseen is being abandoned by her most experienced commanders. Duiker argues that is only natural after the assassination of the Emperor by her hand, and Bult again counters that she was probably best positioned to see how Kellanved and Dancer were unfit for ruling an Empire."
15,8,"While the Red Blades are masscrying people on the streets of Ehriltan, Fiddler rescues two young girls and returns them home. Their grandfather happens to be Kimloc, a Tanno Spiritwalker, legend of empty promises as he once said he could wipe out the entire Malazan army but instead choose peace and opened up the gates of Karatarang during the conquest. He now gives Fiddler a conch embued with some protective powers as a thank you, and offers to learn Fiddler's story by touching him in order to compose a song for the bridgeburners, but Fiddler declines the touch that would give the Spiritwalker access to all of Fiddler's memories."
16,8,"D'ivers and Soletaken (different kinds of shapeshifters) are converging in the Path of Hands. They hope the Path leads to a gate and passage through the gate offers ascendancy, so all shapeshifters with hopes to ascend are converging. Such ascendancy might even allow one shapeshifter to rule over all the others. Various sources confirm all this including Icarium & Mappo, Sormo E'nath, and Kimloc the Tanno Spiritwalker."
17,9,"There are apparently a host of symbols all around Seven Cities as part of a communication system used by the locals. Duiker is concerned that no-one from the Malazans know how to read them, and that no-one thinks it would be useful. Kalam, a local himself, is concerned that they have mutated enough that he might not understand them well enough anymore, but is reassured by the spy Mebra who claims most new ones are just for misdirection. Mebra owns a debt to the Bridgeburners and helps Kalam as a repayment. Among the symbols are also some inhuman hands that rattle Fiddler and Kalam."
18,9,"Kalam meets up with a spy named Mebra and takes from him the book of Dryjhna (alegedly stolen from the Empire's vaults) to deliver it to Shaik herself that is prophesied to start the Whirlwind of the Apocalypse. Kalam hopes the book will grant him safe passage through the rebellious territory. It is then revealed that Mebra was actually working with a group of Red Blades (Tene Baralta, Lostara Yil) and their plan is to follow the carrier of the book and assassinate Shaik."
19,10,"Icarium and Mappo are attacked by a dozen leopard D'ivers who they kill but Mappo gets injured, and the injury gets infected while Icarium loses his memory of the incident. They later meet Messremb, a Soletaken, who Mappo knows from old. They warm him that Rhyllandaras is on the same path and part ways peacefully."
20,10,"Mappo and Icarium meet Iskaral Pust, High Priest of Shadow in an old temple that was previously dedicated to the Queen of Dreams. Iskaral was expecting them. He is also in the company of Servant, a gift from Ammanas - a life saved for a life taken. Servant evidently has an old and a new (pink) hand."
21,10,"We have been repeatedly informed of a spicy smell that is connected with D'ivers and Soletaken. Once with Fiddler and Kalam encountering the sea monster, and again with Mappo and Icarium encountering Messremb."
22,12,"Felisin, Heboric, and Baudin stick together in the slave ship and on the island with the otataral mines where they arrive. Felisin starts selling her body, on the boat and the island, in exchange for food and other conveniences for her and her companions. In the mines, Skullcap, she is taken under the protective wing of Beneth, who although a slave himself, is considered the master of the slaves and has connections with the local guards. This provides various benefits to Felisin and her companions."
23,12,"The Red Swords is an organisation formed of Seven Cities locals, loyal to the Empire who believe the upcoming rebelion should be crashed with much more decisiveness and brutality than the Empire currently employs, and they are happy to take the initiative and act on their convictions, even against the local Malazan command's wishes. Fiddler encounters them in such an act of brutality when they randomly attacked citizens in the roads of Ehriltan. Kulp, and then some of 7th's soldiers interupt and prevent a similar event in Hissar. We also see that Red Blades are responsible for attempting to assasinate Shaik by helping deliver the book of Dryjhna to her and ambushing her."
24,13,"Coltaine trains the 7th army in city battle, playing out scenarios like protecting refugees, withdrawing with civilians and so on."
25,15,"As Felisin gets increasingly addicted to durhang, her life becoming a blur, Heboric loses respect for her, and Beneth becomes less interested in her, treating her worse and keeps using and gifting her. Meanwhile, Baudin becomes an important asset for Beneth and his operations. When Baudin is seen breaking the curfew, he gets arrested and Beneth tries to buy information for his arrest by offering Felisin to captain Sawark. Sawark turns white on the offer, seemingly recognising her. Beneth becomes suspicious, confronts her, she lies that she was training to be Fener's priestess, Beneth beats her and leaves her on the street. Heboric finds Felisin the next day lying on the ground, takes her back to their home and nurses her. Baudin manages to escape, and goes into hiding."
26,14,"Icarium finds in Iskaral's library various very expensively made books about seemingly trivial subjects and ponders over what civilisation might have produced them. They are all written in an ancient language resembling the Seven Cities lunguage Which Icarium can read surprising Mappo. Icarium thinks it's the same civilisation that built all these rooms around Raraku and Pan'potsun Odhan, perhaps even the first human civilisation. The books a twisted stuff symbol on their spine which triggers a memory in Mappo where himself and some elders approach a group of hooded humans called the Nameless Ones who hold staves that visibly twist."
27,15,"A local malazan guard, Pella, warns Beneth that most guards in the island are Dosii and have become relaxed almost giving up on their duties, asking Beneth to pass the message to Captain Sawark. A couple of weeks later Beneth gives a similar warning to Sawark confirming that many soldiers have been heard to claim they will join the Whirlwind but Sawark seems indifferent."
28,16,"A storm forces Kalam to stop at a Malazan keep, Ladro keep, for shelter. The local guard see him suspiciously and he is forced to show them a Claw emblem to gain their trust and stop their questioning. Lostara arrives with a fellow soldier incognito without raising suspicion from Kalam. She thinks that Kalam conspired with the local guard and so kills the whole lot on her way out the next day to resume following Kalam."
29,16,"After being insulted, a merchant's wife throws a deck of dragons at Kalam, which falls down and gets arrayed with the Rope in the center and various cards of High House Death surrounding him."
30,17,"Underneath Iskaral's temple, Mappo and Icarium find an older structure predating the temple above, predating the Queen of Dreams temple, and built in different stone. They explore going through a blocked entranceway. The place resembles an old forest with trees arrayed. Icarium sniffs that the trees were transferred here centuries ago, via a warren resembling Kurald Galain but somehow corrupted. They find a room filled with tiles with engravings most of which scratched and partly destroyed. The room stinks of old sorcery and an additional magical scent, that of shapeshifting, D'ivers and Soletaken. Mappo and Icarium come to the conclusion that here lies the gate at the end of the Path of Hands and wonder if Iskaral awaits shapeshifting visitors soon."
31,18,"Sormo E'nath attempts a ritual to connect with spirits of the land in a holy place and invites Duiker, Kulp, and Bult to attend it. He believes the spirits are ancient, before seven cities time, belonging to Tellan. With the ritual they all arrive in Tellan where they are assaulted by numerous D'ivers and Soletaken, who are also fighting each other, and a black demon who seems to try to protect them by fighting the shapeshifters. They manage to escape by punching and therefore waking Sormo. Upon returning Sormo admits that one crow within him lies broken and ten remain. He also admits they unfortunately fell upon the Path of Hands, a convergence of shapeshifters, possibly thinking Tellan would provide a safe passage."
32,13,"Fiddler and Kalam have a disagreement right before they split up. Kalam seems eager to use the apocalypse to further hurt Laseen's position while Fiddler feels more loyal to the Empire, and hence is in support of maintaining it strong, even if he feels opposed to the particular Empress."
33,13,"Crokus struggles to understand why Kalam split up from them, but they are still all headed to the same place. Part of Fiddler's rationalisation is that this way they increase their chances that at least one of them will make it and Crokus comes to believe that in such a case Apsalar might have to play the role of the assassin as he cannot see Fiddler being up for assassinating the Empress himself."
34,13,"In the Seven Cities continent, a rebelion has been prophesised to occur. Shaik, sometimes called a Seer, is prophesised to lead it. Shaik is based in Raraku, the holy dessert, the dessert also being associated with Dryjhna some kind of fire aspected deity, who is also called the Apocalyptic, or the Wirlwind godess. The heart of Dryjhna is said to be held in the book of Dryjhna, which is why the book needs to be opened by Shaik in order for the Apocalypse to be kicked off. Rebelion, the Apocalypse and the Whirlwind generally refer to the same thing and will be used interchangeably."
35,19,"The massacre of civilians in Aren by Tlan Imass comes up twice in conversations with Fiddler. Once with one of Kimloc's guards, and again with Fiddler and Apsalar. Apsalar claims that the order came from Laseen, that Dancer went to investigate, had a private meeting with her and should have killed her but didn't. It then becomes apparent to Fiddler and Crokus that Dancer became the Rope and Kellanved Shadowthrone. When confronted by Fiddler, on why did Dancer not make himself known to old friends and allies such as Whiskeyjack, Dujek, Kalam etc, when the Rope possessed Apsalar, Apsalar claims Dancer only ever trusted two men, Kellanved and Dassem. Dassem was dead, and Kellanved became less trustworthy after ascending."
36,19,"Fiddler, Crokus and Apsalar continue their journey disguised as newly wed pilgrims with their Gral guard (Fiddler), and go through a series of violent incidents with Fiddler's horse biting off the face of a soldier and the whole team taking down a few would be rapists. All happening in and around Gdanisban that has recently been liberated by the rebelion and in the midst of a massacre of the local Malazan population. They managed to escape reprocrussions and maintained their disguise but got appaled by the violence."
37,20,"Kalam gets surprised, immobilised, and thrown from his horse by Shaik's bodyguard, the Toblakai. Shortly after, he delivers the book of Apocalypse into the hands of Shaik. Even though he refuses to join the ranks of the rebellion, Shaik foresees some value in him and his mission and gifts him an aptorian demon as a companion (Apt). A demon originally sent by Shadowthrone and taken over by Shaik."
38,20,"To follow the prophecy, Shaik sat down at dawn, opened the book of the apocalypse but suddenly died by a quarrel shot by Lostara Yil. The dozen Red Blades then attacked Shaik's two bodyguards, were driven back, and eventually retreated taking heavy losses. Tene Baralta orders Lostara Yil to keep following Kalam, while he heads to Pan'Potsum to spread the word of Shaik's death."
39,22,"The Dosii guards attack Beneth and his men as well as the Malazan guards, and in the confusion Pella reunites Felisin with Baudin and Heboric and urges them all to use the occasion to escape. They have an escape plan, route, and some food/equipment left for them so they can make it through swimming and crossing the nearby desert. It is reveailed that Duiker is responsible for the rescue even though he wasn't that close with Heboric, and in spite the fact Heboric had severely criticised the man and his histories. Heboric admits he owns the man an apology. On their way they see the Dosin plain in flames, an indication of a conflagration, and that the Whirlwind has been unleashed."
40,22,A swarm of bugs attack Felisin that bite and leave larvae in the skin that must quickly get eradicated. She treats the bites in time to save her life but she will probably be permanently scared.
41,24,"Duiker asks Kulp to help him rescue Heboric. Kulp agrees and they travel to a small coastal town to acquire a boat. There they meet a small Malazan garrison that is getting overwhelmed by a rebellious mob backed up by a female High Mage. Kulp and three soldiers, Stormy, Gesler and Truth, scarcely survive the exchange, board a ship, and since nearby Hissar seems to be in flames decide to head straight to Heboric's rescue. The fact that the three soldiers happen to be part of a Fener cult helps. Duiker decides to remain back, disguised as a local (as we have seen him doing before) and ride back to seek Coltaine."
42,27,"By the time Duiker returns in Hissar hostilities have stopped. Coltaine's forces seemingly made a stand and retreated with ten thousand refugees, moving south. The rebels, led by the high mage Kamist Reloe, outnumbered the Malazans seven to one and remain in persue. Coltaine is expected to meet and get burdened by even more refugees, before being circled and his whole force massacred. It's all expected to happen in the next few days. But as Duiker follows the trail it becomes clear that Coltaine won the first round of hostilities, and the rebels will need to regroup."
43,27,"Felisin, Heboric and Baudin, encounter a huge jade pillar that seems to be a finger, with a second finger just visible underneath the sand. Heboric touches it causing sustained pain, and some kind of inflammation."
44,29,"Heboric's tattoos seem to be moving and expanding. Felisin explains that there is a center piece to the pattern which is like a key to the boar God. In his hands there used to be another pattern and combining the two the priest had access to the boar god's warren, with something like a hand to the chest move. By cutting of his hands the priesthood ensured Heboric would never have the same privilege. However, as the tattoos keep moving and expanding it is clear that the ex-priest has not lost favour with the god himself. As Heboric, being the oldest of the three, soon gets exhausted by crossing the desert and falls unconscious, Baudin searches for that key in the hope of getting Fener's attention enough to save Heboric's life and touches Heboric's stump with his chest. They all get knocked out as apparently Fener himself steps on the mortal realm and flees. They believe he stepped through unwillingly, and that he is made vulnerable by doing so. On the bright side, Heboric feels rejuvenated after the incident."
45,30,"Fiddler, Crokus and Apsalar, are fleeing approaching members of a Gral tribe that threaten to undo their disguise (Fiddler pretending to be Gral). They get caught up in the storm that is the Whirlwind where numerous D'ivers and Soletaken fight each other around them and to the storm they are unable to outpace them. One of the beasts pushes Fiddler off his horse and stumbles on him crashing an ankle and several ribs. A D'ivers named Gryllen, in the form of thousand rats, known to Fiddler because he escaped Y'Ghatan's flames during the conquest, is about to attack them but at the last minute Icarium and Mappo intervene and take the group under their protection."
46,31,Heboric's tattoos have grown to the point that he appears to be completely black.
47,31,"As Felisin had grown affectionate for Beneth, she now blames Baudin for abandoning Beneth while they escaped, adding another layer to their already strained relationship. As the three of them reach the shore, Felisin has no hope of being rescued, and anticipates imminent death as they are running out of water. She resolves to at least avenge Beneth as a last act of defiance. She offers to sleep with Baudin and attempts to kill him with one of his own daggers when he falls alseep. Baudin anticipates this, stops her and retrieves the weapon. So instead of being used, Baudin uses her instead. Baudin is testing her to see whether Felisin will go through with her plan, to see if she has changed. Baudin also reveals he killed Beneth himself before they left because he deserved it."
48,31,"Although Felisin felt Baudin and Heboric almost as family through the whole ordeal, Felisin starts developing bad feelings for them both. With Heboric it starts from his contempt about Felisin's choices (prostitution, durhang addiction) and with Baudin with some distrust as he seems to keep hiding secrets. The feelings get worse as she feels that both owe her their lives for the various favours she managed to get for them. With Felisin growing affectionate towards Beneth, this distrust develops to pure hatred for Baudin as he apparently killed instead of saving Beneth on their escape from Skullcap. As a result, following their escape Felisin will always take up an opportunity to talk down or wound the other two, becoming fairly cruel."
49,32,"Upon meeting Heboric, Kulp, with his warren assisted vision, sees a ghost hand, his left, gripping Fener's warren, while on the right hand two powers seem in conflict, one red, otataral, the other green, an alien power surprisingly withstanding otataral."
50,33,Gesler and Stormy are old Malazan veterans (marines) that were left to guard a small garrison probably for their involvement in a cult of Fener. Cool-headed and quick in adapting to horrors. Truth is the newest recruit to the cult.
51,33,"Upon reaching the coast to find Heboric, Kulp and the others had to go through a sorcerous storm, conjured by a mad wizard, with Kulp providing sufficient protection for many hours in order to reach the shore. Kulp believes that the wizard was probably a victim of otataral's influence, probably a prisoner himself, who upon opening his warren was consumed with its chaotic madness and did not anymore maintain any control over it. In any case the sorcerous storm is extremely powerful and random. Hoping that Heboric and his weird connection with otataral will provide sufficient protection from the storm, Kulp argues to go ahead, but Heboric's protection proves to be insuficient. They swiftly get caught in the storm and are transported inside a warren where their boat starts sinking in some kind of water of milk-thick consistency. Stormy gets a severe wound in the process, and Baudin hurts his hands by holding on to Truth saving his life. Heboric manages to heal Stormy by touching his wound with his God touched hand. Kulp notices something beyond healing being passed on. Stormy's wound closes and some tattoos appear. Baudin refuses a similar healing and ends up with a bandaged hand. Just before their boat sinks they find an old abandoned ship nearby, from Quon, pre-imprerial, and get abroad. Baudin recognises the ship as Silanda, the only Quon ship sanctioned to trade with Drift Avali."
52,34,"What appears to have happened in the “Silanda” is the following: a small group of Tiste Edur (four of them?) took control of the vessel, beheaded all of the crew (Tiste Andii and humans) and put their corpses at work. Lots of corpses are downstairs as if ready to oar, their heads inside sealskins scattered all around. Both corpses and heads perfectly preserved. Then the four Endur probably met something even nastier that killed them all - three look like crashed and twisted, the fourth, presumably the captain, killed by a spear that looks like barghast, but much bigger. On the captain's table various maps were scattered depicting lands that Kulp does not recognise. Gesler takes from the dead captain a bone whistle and by using it the oarsmen get to work, and all the heads start staring at him."
53,35,"Mappo and Icarium take Fiddler, Apsalar and Crokus back to the temple of Shadow where Iskaral Pust, with some help from Mappo, heal Fiddler's many wounds: a shattered ankle (Iskaral put him on surgery to save the leg), punctured lung, broken ribs."
54,36,"Through the ever confusing musings of Iskaral Pust is revealed that Fiddler's plan is to reach Tremorlor. Fiddler explains Quick Ben's belief that one of the hidden ways of Raraku (roads only visible when the wind is right), leads to Tremorlor, a fabled Azath house existing somewhere in the dessert. It is also Quick's belief that one can enter such houses (like Kellanved nad Dancer entered the Deadhouse) and that the houses communicate and indeed one can be transferred from one to another almost instantaneously. So the plan is to go in Tremorlor and get out through the Deadhouse in Malaz city which is a half day sail away from Itko Kan and Apsalar's old village. Mappo and Icarium agree to accompany them on this trip. Pust also claims they do not need to worry about Apsalar getting repossessed as Anomander's threat, and therefore protection, still stands. Pust, however, seems concerned about Apsalar's lingering abilities. Finally, Pust makes a lot of predictions about what each one will find in this trip to Tremorlor and also mentions the Chain of Dogs, the Whirlwind's ability to battle it and more. He eventually vanishes while everyone feels like they have been heavily influenced by his ramblings, almost like being under a spell, ""magic powerful enough to drive gods to their knees"" in Icarium's words. Fiddler expresses the feeling of all of them being players in a vast game driven by unseen hands. "
55,38,"Kalam encounters a small group of locals claiming to be part of the Apocalypse, shortly after they have attacked a small group of refugees. As they go back at night to finish them, Kalam joins in with the refugees and kill the bandits. The refugees turn out to be captain Keneb, the wife, Slev, the wife's sister Minala, and two kids. Keneb knows Kalam by name. They go back to finish off the last bandit left behind to guard the livestock. The bandit has company, and Kalam single handedly kills all 8 of them awing Minala. Apt also killed a couple but stayed out of sight. Through the various exchanges Kalam learns that Kamist Reloe is in charge of an area to the South East and is going after Coltaine. South, there is another army under Korbolo Dom who was a Fist until he married local royalty and turned renegade. Korbolo had to put down almost half of his men for not wanting to follow him going rogue. Now he prepares to attack Aren, which apparently is the only major city not already taken by the Apocalypse. The bandits' also spoke of a Jhistal (some kind of priest to Mael, also used by Duiker to address Mallick Rel) as an ally in the city. Kalam remembers Korbolo as a superb tactician, but too bloodthirsty. He was the replacement of Whiskeyjack for a while."
56,39,"A group of Logros T'lan Imass appear on board of the Silanda. They were hunting. They mistake everyone on board for followers of the Chained One, and contemplate killing them but reconsider. They seem to be following kin, probably the ones who killed the Tiste Edur. Hendos Ilm, a bonecaster, kills the otataral mad sorceror and the tempest resolves, showing clear skies and a rent in the sky expanding. One of the T'lan, Legana Breed, a clanless, volunteers to seal the rent with his soul. But looks like he also took one of the Tiste heads along for the ride. Just before doing so he gifts his sword to Stormy. We also learn the group is in Kurald Emurlahn which was recently flooded. Kurald Emurlahn is an elder warren that Kulp did not recognise even though it's the parent plane of Meanas, Kulp's own warren."
57,41,"It took Duiker 3 months to catch up with Coltaine but he finally joined him near the Sekalta river. The Fist was surrounded by enemy forces, and was preparing to cross the river. A new regime of marines had joined him (after their ship broke down near Hissar) with captain Lull leading them. He is harbouring around 30 thousand refugees. Coltaine has been pushing everyone hard to keep moving with minimal rest. We also learn from Sormo that the Path of Hands has pretty much rendered the warrens in the area useless which has prevented Kamist Reloe from using his power against them."
58,44,"Coltaine faces the two armies flanking him and emerges victorious. Duiker witnesses the conflagration with List appointed as his personal detouche. A few things that contributed to their victory were the warlocks' awakening of local spirits that materialised by spreading horror on anyone stepping in a small forest, and with an ancient undead army that attacked the Apocalypse armies (to little effect other than the shock factor and buying time), the marines who laid a road to assist movement along the river shallows, and then blowing up the whole thing to flood it while enemies were crossing, the Wickan's impeccable timing, and warlocks providing the communication among the companies to coordinate everything. They had of course significant losses, primarily with Lull's marines, the Weasel clan, and the 7th. The small Red Blades company made a heroic last stand, and two warlocks were lost as well. The detonation that flooded the river effectively separated Kamist Reloe's army from Coltaine. Kamist will now probably have to walk for days before finding another passage. But the other army icluding the Guran infantry and the Semk remain close. The initial plan to head to Ubaryd is adandoned as the city seems to be taken, and the next plan is to head to Aren."
59,44,"The tribe of Semk is also part of the Apocalypse army and is driven by a Semk God, a powerful old ascendant. Sormo informs them that the ascendant uses the bodies of his devotees to channel his rage, indiffirent that the practice disintigrates many of the wizards. Coltaine tells him to take more drastic measures. The same night Duiker witnesses a ritual carried out by Sormo, Nil and Nether. They are transformed in an icy landscape, result of a Jaghut ritual that has imprisoned numerous human and other bodies and body parts in varying degrees of decomposition. Among them is also the Semk God boiling in rage. The warlocks help releasing him so that the local spirits can feed on him, removing the threat of the Semk god and gaining additional favour with the local spirits at the same time."
60,45,"Kulp tries to transfer them out of the flooded realm, to Meanas and then their own world, but one of the problems is that such travels should follow some basic rules such as moving from sea to sea, land to land etc, and he cannot find any bodies of water in Meanas. Suddenly, he feels an immensely powerful being passing through (he can only compare its power to Anomander or Osric, and he should know of others of such power) in the form of an ancient looking undead dragon, visibly larger than Anomander, and he attempts to ride the current left behind its path (shadows feel more solid here). He opens a rend that gets larger by being in the vacuum of the dragon's path, and the weight of the ship and the water following it. The weight of the water keeps stretching it and he is afraid of having caused a catastrophic event for Meanas. He tries to seal the rent, and only manages to do so after the dragon lends him some help. Following the dragon's attention comes some other ascendant's attention followed by others as well. According to Stormy, the mage was levitating in blue flames during the incident."
61,46,"The undead dragon plunges into an unknown warren full of fire and Silanda involuntarily follows. Baudin trying to save Felisin, grabs her, runs, and jumps off the ship landing somewhere in Raraku. Baudin, believing he would be obliterated by the fire is startled to find out he is alive and the fire instead of incinerating him, merely tempered him. They find Kulp and Heboric nearby. The three marines went under deck in the Silanda during the incident and are presumed dead."
62,46,"Kulp finally confronts the party about who Baudin really is. It is uncovered that he was sent as a bodyguard to Felisin, himself a Talon. Talons where an undercover group of assassins started by Dancer. Following Dancer's apparent death, Laseen turned her claws against the Talons, the claws won, Lassen became empress and the Talon is considered dead and gone. But a handful survived, and some pased the secret art to their sons, along with the knowledge that Dancer and Kellanved ascended instead of dying. Baudin is one such son. Felisin muses that her sister probably tried to reach such an undercover organisation for this so that no one would know. Baudin should probably have left Skullcap with Felisin much sooner, if only Felisin wanted to leave. Upon finding out, Felisin sents Baudin away."
63,47,"Iskaral Pust allegedly learned from a reading of the Deck of Dragons that Shaik was assassinated by a group of Red Blades, and as a result Mappo and Icarium went out in search of her body before coming across Fiddler and the others. Mappo is concerned that Iskaral might want to use Apsalar to complete the prophecy of a Shaik reborn. Fiddler share his concern again of being caught in a plan that will soon result in his death, and that while he can usually avoid such danger, he is now unsure. Mappo goes on to explain that in the basement lies a room with tiles on the floor resembling a deck of dragons, but older, probably depicting holds not warrens. And he believes there lies the gate that the shapeshifters seek while Iskaral is trying to distract them from the true path. Fiddler suggests that Iskaral might be trying to keep Mappo and Icarium close as a last defense in case the shapeshifters find them."
64,47,Mappo admits to Fiddler that his mission is to prevent Icarium from uncovering his past and Fiddler marvels at how can a friendship like theirs stand. Icarium remaining generous even when he is being denied to progress (being striped from his memories) and Mappo remaining visibly sad by preventing his companion this progress.
65,48,Mappo and Icarium come to the conclusion that Servant is probably Apsalar's father. He had been hiding from her and now rides out into Raraku alone. They assume Iskaral itends to use him as leverage to push Apsalar into becoming Shaik. And so they all ride after Servant into Raraku.
66,47,Fiddler gets a feeling that in a strange way Iskaral Pust reminds him of Quick Ben. The endless schemes and plans within plans within plans.
67,48,"Mappo is carrying a weapon made of a long bone of an unknown beast and enchanted by seven Trell witches, a weapon of great power which he rarely uses. He is also in the possession of a pack that opens up to a small warren which is effectively endless allowing him to store there a horde of things, including various people he put in there in fits of anger and he never saw again. The enchantment was supposed to only last weeks or months but has now lasted centuries."
68,48,"Icarium tries to confront Mappo about his lost memories, as a lot of his past should exist as Mappo's memories. Apparently this is a recurring theme between them. But this time Icarium takes it one step further by wondering wether Mappo himself has something to do with the hidden truths of his past."
69,47,"Bhok'arala, are small winged monkey-like creatures with human-like faces. They are everywhere in the Shadow temple and apparently properly worship Iskaral as their god, making offerings, following rituals and so on, while Iskaral himself is chasing them, throwing them rocks which are then collected as holy."
70,48,"Crokus is becoming over-protective of Apsalar, showning anger every time there is a hint of someone hoping to use Apsalar and her skills for their ends. He has also been training with his knives showing some improvement in Fiddler's eyes."
71,49,"Kalam, along with his small Malazan retinue, are unable to pass Korbolo Dom's army so Kalam decides to use Quick Ben's gift which transports then all into the Imperial Warren. His aim is to reach Aren this way. Kalam did not expect the warren to be reaching that far from Unta. Shortly after, Lostara Yil meets the Claw Pearl and together they step through the same portal to follow them."
72,49,"The outskirts of Korbolo Dom's army is lined by crucified Malazans, many of which are children. Kalam wants to help them but feels powerless to do so. Apt gathers up 1300 children from the crosses and takes them to the Shadow realm where Shadowthrone eventually agrees to adopt them and heal them. Apt is female and used to be the concubine of an Aptorian demon lord. Apt claims one child as her own, Panek, who rides her and together they follow Lostara and Pearl into the Imperial Warren."
73,51,Duiker was picked up by Kellanved to become the Imperial historian. He was a soldier in his thirties who didn't know how to read or write. Toc the elder taught him. Kellanved later also provided him some alchemical gifts that allowed Duiker to prolong his life span and heal faster.
74,52,"The Chain of Dogs had been plagued by endless raids producing steady losses of soldiers that Coltaine could not sustain if he wished to reach Aren. They believe a new Tithansi warleader is to blame, so they arrange an assassination mission. Sappers start throwing ammunitions to cover a small group of marines, 2 warlocks and Duiker who successfully find the warleader and kill him but then realise the real danger is a Semk warleader. Apparently one of the spirits that devoured the Semk God got so influenced by its food that turned against them. They were unable to eliminate the Semk warleader and were forced to restreat losing 17 soldiers in the fight, marking this probably the first fail of Coltaine, but at least they learned a lot."
75,53,"Felisin, Kulp and Heboric are seeking refuge from the storm in Raraku. They enter a cave and find themselves in what seems to be an ancient structure with some glass showing. Heboric has hands now that might be invisible allow him to grab things and people. He is also raving, seemingly like a madman but a lot of what he is saying seems to be true in an unseen level. He seems to get some information by touching things. From him we learn that this place was part of the First Empire, where some kind of ritual unleashed terrible power that resulted in many people becoming Soletaken or D'ivers, many driven mad and turned on each other. Shapeshifting was considered a more primitive alternative to ascension, and there were some attempts to ease the passage. In any case, T'lan Imass attended the ritual and many of them died. The area is full of dead bodies turned to stone. Ancient alchemies kept the bodies young even after death, and they petrified in time along with everything else. We also learn that the undead Soletaken dragon was a T'lan Imass."
76,54,"The Imperial warren is in an apparent continual dusk, shadowless, and full of ash. Kalam suspects the ash is crumpled bones, similar to the many bones they have encountered underfoot and confirmed his suspicion when they came across a sink hole where layers of charred bone could be seen one atop the other. At the bottom lay several ancient large mechanisms that reminded Kalam of Icarium's time machine in Darujhistan. In the distance, clouds announce other visitors on the warren, shapeshifters judging by the smell."
77,54,"Keneb mentions that local Seers have been unable to complete readings of the Deck of Dragons because they are getting stuck on the first card, obelisk. Icarium has been spotted in Pan'potsun and they believe he is the reason why."
78,55,"Keneb shares Minala's story to Kalam. She was married to a Colonel to stay close to her sister. A Colonel that abused her repeatedly (with the help of the garrison's healer), attempting to break her like a horse."
79,55,"On their retreat from the Tithansi warleader, Duiker noticed that they received help from an unseen Claw that not even Coltaine knew about. That Claw was Pearl, who while in the Imperial Warren found the opportunity and jumped into the fight along with Lostara Yil. During the conflagration they came face to face with the Semk, Lostara got seriously injured, and Pearl was preparing to die, when Apt appeared. Apt dissected the Semk removing from his insides a piece pulsating hate and saved them all."
80,59,"Crossing the next river was expected to lead to another conflagration. Coltaine, despite being grossly outnumbered, managed one again to emerge victorious. The Weasel clan remained behind to guard the refugees where they managed to obliterate the Tithansi while earth spirits were devouring the Semk God. This allowed the rest of the forces to move forward unburdened by the refugees. The 7th managed to guard the wounded while Wickans rode horses dressed in arcane looking heavy armour that transformed them into some kind of heavy infantry surprising and trampling Kamist Reloe's elites and main army. Nil and Nether's effective sacrifice of a horse to give others unnatural strength and stamina helped, as did the sappers that hid themselves inside enemy lines to join in the fray with munitions at the heat of the battle. Lull gets an ugly scarring and losses an eye."
81,59,"Some kind of relationship has been building between Duiker and a nameless marine. He covered their retreat on the ambush of the Tithansi warlord and earned her respect. He was attracted by her but being much older he never acted on it. They met a few more times, and finally faught together again when she vowed to ride him if they survived the fight."
82,59,"Inside the Imperial warren Kalam encounters an old half buried dome and in its tiles recognises the symbol of Kallor. Caladan Brood's second, rumoured to be thousand years old and claiming to have commanded vast empires that he destroyed himself."
83,60,"After traveling in the imperial warren for a long time, unsure about when to exit and how to get to his destination, Kalam finally decides to exit and arrives in Aren. Entering the first inn he could find he meets a captain bound to leave for Unta along with 20 marines and the High Fist's treasurer. Apparently, someone calling himself Salk Elan had arranged for Kalam to meet the Captain. He intends to leave everyone behind, only saying goodbye to Minala, but Minala sets out after him."
84,60,Lostara Yil and Pearl arrive in Aren following Kalam. Lostara goes to report to the local Red Blade commander and is promptly disarmed and arrested. Apparently the Red Blades have been arrested and charged with treason.
85,62,"Felisin, Heboric, and Kulp are being hunted by shapeshifters and escape into Raraku and the Whirlwind. There they meet a merchant with 4 undead servants with a dome protecting them from the Whirlwind. He offers healing and even proposes for Felisin to stay with him in exchange of a very comfortable life. He claims to have been given shelter from the storm as a follower of Dryjhna. In truth, he is the D'ivers Gryllen and taking the form of numerous rats he devours Kulp as he turns to meet Messremb who had been battering at his dome of protection. Baudin appears in an attempt to save Felisin and Heboric bringing fire to fight the D'ivers. Heboric gets bitten and now the madness of the D'ivers is fighting inside his body with all the other powers. Baudin gets badly burned in the process barely surviving the engagement and dies shortly after. He mistakenly thought the recent passing through the warren of fire would have provided him with some immunity to fire."
86,64,"High Fist Promqual is sending his treasurer along with the treasury to Unta on the Ragstopper, and his personal belongings with another vessel. Kalam boards the Ragstopper and Minala the other ship. Promqual has also put Admiral Nok under imprisonment to prevent the fleet from mobilising, all apparently without the Empress knowing as word on the street is that there hasn't been a Claw in the city for a long time."
87,66,"There is an ongoing tension between the military command of the Chain of Dogs and the noble representatives of the refugees led by Nethpara. Coltaine used servants of the nobles, equipped with shields, on the first major battle and the nobles protested going as far as writing down all servants missing and their worth. After the servants were returned to them, Coltaine proceeded to buy the servants off the nobles attaching them to the 7th. Other complains of the nobles included the order of marching, ratios of food and water and so on. Coltaine remained indifferent to their demands, until , a captain of the 7th who was noble born argued for their case too much and ended up getting demoted. The argument was about retaking Ubaryd and hoping for support from the Imperial fleet. Coltaine believed there was no support to be expected, holding Ubaryd themselves was impossible, so he believed the only route forward was to march to Aren."
88,67,"Heboric sees tormented souls chained to the Toblakai, of people he has killed and takes an aggressive stance towards him. It escalates to the point that the Toblakai swears to kill him and refrains from speaking to him until then."
89,67,"Shaik's two bodyguards, Leoman and the Toblakai, remain guards over Shaik's body and the book of Dryjhna for a long time. As the Whirlwind finally calms, they encounter Felisin and Heboric and recognise Felisin as Shaik reborn. Younger but with the same fire burning inside her. Pain giving birth to rage. Felisin plays along but does not fully embrace her new role of being the Shaik reborn. She asks Heboric to stay with her,  although their relationship is rocky. She wants to keep him alive and guide him to the oasis as repayment for Baudin's sacrifice. Leoman expects her to open the book of Dryjhna before they arrive on the camp. The ritual should either confirm her as Shaik reborn or kill her."
90,68,"Fiddler, Crokus, Mappo and Icarium walk through the ruins of an ancient city. Icarium is leading, almost like he knows where he is going, and arrive in a circle where seven immense scorpion sting thrones once stood. ""Seven main avenues within each city of the first empire. The Sky Spirits look down upon the holy number, seven scorpion tails, seven stings facing the circle of sand. To all who would make offerings to the Seven Hollies, look to the circle of sand"". The thrones, along with the city have been utterly destroyed, by Icarium. Apparently thousands of T'lan imass tried to oppose him in addition to the habitants of the city and all lie buried in the sands. The only surviving offering is a large mechanism of Icarium's own making, that from what Icarium can understand was built and offered 94 thousand years ago, although he himself has trouble believing it. He is also having trouble understanding who could deliver such destruction."
91,68,"The Nameless Ones were apparently formed during the First Empire. They initially followed a god but then changed course and follow someone else, whose power is arguably manifested from their staves."
92,69,"Crokus lingers a bit behind and captures Iskaral Pust who had been following them. Apsalar has gone ahead with her father Rellock (Servant) to finish off planting the false trail of the Path of Hands, leading straight to the Azath house Tremorlor. We also learn that there is a torn warren filled with pain and rage nearby which is the true heart of Raraku, and the Azath house is pinning it down."
93,70,"Gesler, Stormy, and Truth land in the river Vathar aboard the Silanda where they meet Duiker who is with Nether and the Foolish Dog clan. Traveling through that warren of fire seems to have changed the three men, giving them a permanent bronze hue, but more importantly, giving them almost super human powers. According to Nil, they are nearly ascendants. In an argument about promoting them Coltaine punches Gesler on the face, knocking him down and breaking his wrist in return, making everyone wonder if Gesler is almost ascendant, what about Coltaine?"
94,71,"The Toblakai claims to be Raraku's revenge, and upon seeing a few massacred men sets out to hunt and kill the shapeshifter who did it before returning to the others. Felisin embraces the role of Shaik reborn and orders each one of her companions to open the book of Dryjna. Leoman sees empty pages, the Toblakai sees beauty that makes him weep. Heboric refuses to open it. The Toblakai makes a move on him with Felisin's permission but Heboric disarms him and throws him away. Felisin tells Heboric he was never abandoned by his God, only prepared. In her new-found role Felisin drops the bitterness and wants to keep Heboric close for his wisdom."
95,72,"Fiddler and therest of the  group finally catch up with Apsalar and her father Rellock. They proceed to enter Raraku's fragmented warren which is full of trees, that slowly thin out giving way to a barren landscape. Myriad roots remain underneath. Mappo being afraid that the Azath might imprison Icarium has second thoughts and asks Icarium to go back. Imprisonment could be a good solution but he would lose his friend. Besides, the Azath is already struggling with the burden of the warren and now the incoming shapeshifters. Maybe trying to take Icarium would be too much. Icarium confronts Mappo about the obvious conflict he is having wanting to help. Mappo reveals Icarium was the one who destroyed the city they passed in Raraku and as a result Icarium sees the prospect of imprisonment as just, embraces it and asks Mappo to accompany him for a last time."
96,73,"The roots underfoot rise to create some kind of a structure, a maze. Iskaral apparently brought Icarium here to fight protecting the Azath, but the group gets concerned that if his rage takes him he will lose control and can possibly turn on the house itself with unpredictable reprocusions. Their solution is for everyone to get ready to fight and only use Icarium as a last resort. Crokus even pushes Iskaral and his God to chip in and the five Hounds of Shadow appear and join them."
97,73,"Coltaine sends Gesler, Stormy and Truth away on the Silanda along with as many wounded as they can carry."
98,77,"Two pirate ships were chasing Kalam's transport, the Ragstopper. The captain tries to deal with them but is attacked by the treasurer's bodyguard, because as it turns out the pirates are cousins to the treasurer. Kalam and Salk Elan intervene, the marines side with Kalam and they all turn against the pirates. The treasurer summons an enkar'al (a large flying lizard) as retaliation which eventually results to the pirates and marines being all wiped out. The treasurer survives only to be bound to sacks of gold and thrown overboard."
99,77,"Tavore is anticipated to arrive with fresh legions to crash the rebellion. Apparently some provisions have already arrived in Falar ahead of the expected armies. Later, Kalam's ship comes across an Imperial fleet, Tavore's, headed for Seven Cities."
100,78,"The Nameless Ones are revealed to be some kind of servants to the the Azath. Four of them lie dead at the entrance of the maze to Tremorlor. Icarium has seen them in his dreams where it was also revealed to him the numerous guardians he had through the years. Mappo confirms the Nameless Ones are the ones arranging guardians for him, but it's unknown why."
101,78,"It is apparent to the group that the Azath is being attacked in multiple fronts, all the while the older prisoners, myriad powerful individuals and old ascendants are trying to break free. Two fighting Soletaken stubble upon them, a huge brown bear and an enkar'al. Mappo crushes the enkar'al with a single blow, while the beast gets attacked by the Hounds and claimed by the house despite Mappo's protests as this was Messremb, his old friend."
102,79,"Felisin and her companions arrive in Raraku's oasis, a self-sufficient area housing around 40 thousand people. The oasis is built upon the ruins of an ancient city, the last standing island city of the First Empire, which according to Heboric fell in violence by brutal invaders. Felisin has so far refused to open the book of Dryjhna, but various manifestations of power make it obvious that the Godess favours her so she is greeted as Shaik reborn, and even manages to makes the three arch-mages to kneel before. She already knows the mages, knowledge she persumes comes from the older Shaik. The three mages are Bidithal, who once abused young Shaik, Febryl who tried to poison Shaik and once run from Dassem betraying the cause, and Loric who is a mystery. Felisin announces the marching out of the oasis, raising a tall column of sand as a banner for everyone to see in the continent."
103,80,"In Tremorlor's maze, Fiddler and company come face to face with Gryllen, get pushed back and are almost overwhelmed. Icarium was reaching his rage, when Fiddler accidentally throws and shatters the conk he got from Kimloc the Tanno Spiritwalker. The sorcery unleashed withers out the rats and knocks everyone down, but not before Mappo knocks Icarium out with his club. In the aftermath, the Hounds and Iskaral want to give Icarium to the Azath, which was the initial deal that Icarium accepted, but Mappo now refuses, with Fiddler supporting him. The Jhag is left alone for now."
104,80,"As Coltaine and his forces are approaching another major river, Korbolo Dom's forces are already there. Instead of attacking, Korbolo sends a messenger offering safe passage for the refugees and also want to negotiate about Aren - maybe enough gold can convince him to leave the city alone. Coltaine dismisses the offer, which angers the noble representatives. Korbolo makes his offer again, this time directly to the nobles who accept and the refugees attempt the cross. It turns out to be an ambush. Sappers who had joined the refugees fight back supported by elements of the 7th and some Wickans but the whole thing is a disaster. Sormo is killed in the fight and thousands of yellow butterflies (instead of crows) close on the body to take his soul. Other casualties include around 20.000 refugees, 700 from the 7th with only a score of marines and sappers still standing. Only about 500 warriors remain for each Wickan tribe."
105,81,"Kalam had been having the feeling that there is some serious magical manipulation going on aboard. The captain had been making confusing remarks, hinting at some understanding but normalising it, time seems to pass strangely, weather is overly helpful and strange. He finally decides to use his shaved knuckle in the hole and summon Quick Ben. The wizard confirms that powerful magery is at play, a very rare warren for mortals, but wasn't sure if it came from the ship or somewhere nearby. His guess is that the purpose of the sorcery is taking the cargo somewhere with no crew members remembering where that somewhere is."
106,83,"List has been having visions, guided by a Jaghut spirit. In the forest near Vathar they come along the foundations of a Jaghut tower, a couple hundred millennia old, which was the first of many places in the area where Jaghut clashed with the T'lan Imass. List brings Duiker to the first of the Jahgut tombs nearby. This one was of a young boy of five. It proved too hard for the T'lan Imass to kill, so instead they shatterd his bones and pinned him under a large rock, still breathing. The same happened to his kin in more tombs along the way. The emotions that grew around them in time were so strong that local spirits had to go away or fall into madness. List purposes to move quickly through this land and Duiker goes to inform Coltaine."
107,84,"A group of chariots belonging to the Trygalle Trade Guild arrive via warren bringing much needed food and water to the Chain of Dogs, compliment of the city of Darujhistan. They also bring a small vial, gift from Quick Ben, that is given to Coltaine to wear at all times and break upon his skin when the time comes, but Coltaine soon passes it on to Duiker. From the ensuing conversation it is revealed that Dujek is probably not truly outlawed. It's more likely that the Empress saw a greater threat in the Pannion Seer, and Dujek going rogue was the fastest way to ensure they had the allies they needed to oppose him."
108,84,"The Chain of Dogs is preparing for another battle. With Korbolo Dom's forces behind them, three desert tribes (the Tregyn, Bhilard, and Khundryl) ahead of them, vastly outnumbered, tired, starved, and with no release forces from Aren in sight, things look desperate. But the Khundryl proved to be more interested in finding out who the strongest clan is and at the last moment turned against Korbolo and the other tribes. They broke the Bhilard and the Tregyn, and proceeded to shatter the Semk, Can'eld, and Tithansi tribes that were attached to Korbolo, but Korbolo's forces reorganised and eventually pushed them back. In the meantime, the Chain of Dogs remained unopposed. At the end of the engagements a lone Khundryl warchief rides back to Coltaine to recognise his Wickans as the strongest clan."
109,85,"Crokus has kept his late uncle's familiar, Moby, and carried him in the trip. It has long been debated among the group whether Moby is just a pet bhok'arala, or a true familiar, so something more powerful (maybe a demon) disguised as a bhok'arala. With Moby dismembering a soletaken that was pursuing the group, the debate seems to be settled. Moby is eventually confirmed to be a Soletaken demon who had been frequently disappearing in the dessert to protect the group against the shapeshifters. He is now the only one able to open the Azath's door as the house chose him to become its guardian.A multi joined corpse was lying on the house's doorway, and inside a young woman with multiple wounds on her hands is recognised as the daughter of Dassem, who Dassem brought here shortly before turning against his God."
110,85,"Someone knocks on the door of the Azath, Fiddler answers finding a representative of the Trygalle Trade Guild who proceeds to deliver a crate of munitions, sent by Quick Ben."
111,87,"Coltaine appoints Duiker head of the refugees, Nil, Nether and a small group of young Wickans as guards, and order them to head into Aren. The group meet a gathered tribe, the Kherahn, offer to pay for their passage according to Malazan treaties and the tribe not only accepts but offer supplies and to guard them on the way. Meanwhile, Coltaine with his remaining forces stays behind to fight Korbolo Dom and delay him long enough for the refugees to make it."
112,88,"After purchasing horses from the Krelahn, the nobles want to go ahead into Aren leaving the rest behind. Duiker refuses, a noble calls him out to a duel and Duiker promptly knocks him out. The ongoing tension between the nobles and the soldiers charged to protect them keeps building up."
113,88,"With presumably Korbolo Dom close on their tracks, Duiker manages to deliver the refugees to Aren. The gate opens and a few soldiers help to get everyone inside, with captain Keneb personally receiving a young lost boy who Duiker picked up from the chaos. The walls of the city are filled with soldiers who have strict orders to go no further."
114,89,"Kalam, on the deck of the Ragstopper is looking out into Malaz city, when he suddenly finds himself unable to move. Salk Elan appears on his side, reveals himself as Pearl and announces that even thought the Empress wants to personally talk with Kalam, there is a score to be settled first. Kalam left the Claw earning a death penalty settled by the Claw itself. The fact that Kalam was one of the best, only makes things worse. Pearl admits admiring him and that Kalam could very well be the head of the Claw had he remained. Pearl informs Kalam there are three hands (groups) of Claw awaiting him in Malaz city, stubs him on his side and throws him in the sea breaking the spell. He trusts Kalam to at least make it to the shore despite his chain mail, the bleeding and the sharks."
115,89,"When Apt rescues the children and brings them into the shadow realm, she chooses one, Panek, to become her rider. Shadowthrone heals the child and upon Apt's request he merges the eyes of the child into a single eye to match Apt. On a later meeting with Apt, Cotillion disaproves of this act until it is revealed that the child, like the hounds of Shadow, can see things from the Shadow Hold within the warren of Shadow. Things that Cotillion himself is oblivious to."
116,89,"After a brief meeting with Cotillion, Apt and Panek set out to help Kalam. They arrive right after Pearl throws Kalam in the sea, turn to Pearl, but only manage to injure him before he manages to summon an Imperial demon and flee."
117,89,"Minala's ship arrives in the Malaz harbour shortly after the Ragstopper, and seeing the demons fighting on board the Ragstopper takes her mount and jumps in the water. The captain, impressed by her act of courage, orders his mage to help her reach her destination, if possible, presumably clearing her path from sharks."
118,89,The captain of the Ragstopper is revealed to be Cartheron Crust of the old guard. He and the crew are saved from Pearl due to Apt's arrival.
119,91,"Once inside the city, Duiker along with the two warlocks take the stairs to reach a platform along the outer wall where High Fist Pormqual, Mallick Rel, commander Blistig and a few others stand, all watching Coltaine and the remnants of his army making a last stand on one of the closest mounts outside Aren. They have impossibly survived and slowly fought in retreat of Korbolo Dom's forces all this time - buying the necessary time for the refugees to reach Aren. Now an army behind walls watches them getting slaughtered. Duiker and Blistig make repeated pleas to Promqual to interfere sending some troops out but the High Fist refuses claiming the enemy force is too large. And so they watch the few last Wickans and elements of the 7th go down, including List, Lull, Bult, and lastly Coltaine himself. Korbolo and Kamist Reloe do not kill Coltaine straight away, but instead, they nail him to a cross, and as a cloud of crows approaches, Kamist reloe keeps unleashing sorcerous attacks obliterating them. Nil has fallen unconscious and Nether screams for Coltaine's release. Finally, Blistig calls a soldier, Squint, who with a long bow manages to reach Coltaine and kill him, resulting in the cloud of crows decending on the scene, overcoming Kamist Reloe's sorcerous attacks, and leaving without a trace of Coltaine left behind."
120,92,"Kalam arrives at the shore but missing his armour and weapons, so his first stop is in a nearby warehouse where he collects some basic tools as weapons. His gamble is that his hunters will be over relying on magic and their magically enhanced vision to spot him. Instead he uses the highest discipline of the Claw, stopping his bleeding and slowing his temperature to became more invisible. It works well and he takes out the first Hand of the Claw retrieving some weapons and equipment along the way. He also passess on a message to Topper that he is going after him. The three initial Hands sent to hunt him, will become many more."
121,92,"Fiddler and his companions are traveling on what they can only describe as the Azath warren. A vast place, flat, with tiles underfoot that provide some illumination, and seem to depict small fragments of maps, possibly the location of other houses. Holes appear every now and then, with Iskaral disappearing in one first, and then Mappo and Icarium. The ones who remain fear the others might have died, until three ochre dragons flying ahead dive through the floor far ahead and dissappear. Throught the floor seems to be the way out."
122,93,"In the Vathar crossing the nobles took the initiative of taking Korbolo's deal and started the crossing which ended in a disaster. Nethpara's actions, the main spokesperson for the nobles, gained the eerie of Duiker who almost strungled him in a fit of rage when the noble blamed Coltaine for the disaster in the crossing. Nethpara only survived because someone intervened and stopped Duiker. With Coltaine's death, Duiker, along with most other survivors retreated in a hazy numb state, embracing oblivion, walking like a ghost. People kept talking to him but meaning escaped him. By the time Blistig managed to shake him out of it, Nethpara, had the opportunity to spin the tale of the Chain of Dogs alone, painting Coltaine as a war criminal, responsible for slaughering thousands of refugees. As a result, when Duiker finally comes to meet High Fist Pormqual Duiker is accused as the last remaining officer of Coltaine and is promised a trial and imprisonment. In a fit of fury, Duiker kicks and kills Nethpara in defiance."
123,94,"Mallick Rel finally manages to push High Fist Promqual into action and soldiers are preparing for an attack at the end of the night, following the long celebration of Korbolo Dom's soldiers. The plan is to catch them on their sleep. The whole force of the High Fist hastily drives out of the city and attempts to circle Korbolo's forces, but instead fall into a trap and become encircled themselves. Pormqual panics, and Mallick negotiates on his stead. The whole force is to lay down arms and be taken as hostages. Once Korbolo arrives it is made clear that Mallick Rel was collaborating with him, being responsible for leading everyone here. Instead of taking hostages, they decide to kill everyone by crucifying them along the Aren way. Ten thousand soldiers. Duiker dies nailed on a tree, the small bottle pendant having broken on him about a day earlier. Luckily, a small force has remained back in Aren to defend the city. Keneb heard Duiker call Mallick Jhistal, which triggered a memory of a conversation he and Kalam overheard of some bandits and presumably convinced Blistig to stay behind with his troops."
124,95,Kalam continues his killing spree but he is tiring and his several minor wounds that require extra mental effort to suppress and hide exhaust him to the point that he would have died if not for the timely intervention of a random dog and Minala who shoots down one of his attackers and then takes him on her horse and rides to Mock's Hold where apparently the Empress is.
125,95,"Fiddler, Crokus, Apsalar and Relock fall through the tiles (Fiddler injuring his ankle again) and arrive in another Azath where they meet Gothos, Icarium's father. Gothos is disappointed that the opportunity was missed for the Azath to take his son. He also reveals that the Nameless Ones massacred Mappo's village and blamed Icarium in an attempt to bind him to the cause. Gothos claims that Icarium's rage is a poison and that he is too dangerous to be walking free. Icarium became this way after attempting to free Gothos from the Azath, wounding a warren in the process and damaging himself as a result. He has since lost his memory and his older motivations. Ironically, Gothos never wanted to be freed."
126,96,"Kalam reaches the Empress in Mock's Hold and they have a chat. Kalam's main reasons for going after her were: the desimation of the Bridgeburners, the outlawing of Dujek, the assassination of the Emperor and Dancer, a possible hand in the death Dassem Ultor. She argues that Tayschrenn's efforts in Genabackis were misguided and not expressing her will. She was only interested in undoing Sorry. Dujek going rogue was only a ruse to ensure trust with the new-found allies to face the growing threat of the Pannion Seer. She argues the Empire and its needs are bigger than any particular person and she only stepped in to remove the old Emperor out of what she recognised as necessity. Dassem was a rival, and one sworn to a God so removing him made sense. Kalam is swayed by her attitude and reasoning and decides to stop the hunt, so leaves. Lassen warns him that she cannot recall the Claw. They always deal with their own. Once Kalam leaves it is revealed that Laseen was talking through a corpse while Topper stayed nearby. Topper is not going after Kalam himself, but he is not calling his Claw back either. He intends to use Kalam to weed out the weakest of the Claw."
127,97,"Four more Hands of the Claw appear to hunt Kalam, but Fiddler, Crokus, Apsalar and Relock appear as well as Apt to face them, and Apt eventually transfers everyone in Shadow where they meet Shadowthrone who swears to fulfill their wishes. Crokus, Apsalar and Relock all to go to the Kanese coast to finally return home. Fiddler, instead of returning to the Bridgeburners decides to stay in Malaz Island where he intends to join Tavore's army bound for Seven Cities. Kalam and Minala ask for some refuge, stay in Shadow and are introduced to all the children Apt saved following Kalam's wishes."
128,97,"Felisin arrives with her army near Aren, sees the crucifixions and the numerous dead from battle, and orders the merging of Korbolo's forces into hers before retreating back into Raraku."
129,97,"Tavore arrives in Aren and Blistig, Keneb and the few remnants of the 7th prepare to meet her."
130,98,"Gesler, Stormy and Truth finally deliver the wounded in Aren and immediately disappear again. Mappo arrives somewhere near Aren, with Icarium still unconcious. Mappo walks up to the Aren way where he witnesses the dead and meets Gesler, Stormy and Truth who are inspecting the crucified bodies looking for someone. Truth collects one Wickan dog and a lapdog, the only survivors of Coltaine's last stand. Heavily injured they barely survive but Mappo gets moved and helps healing them."
131,98,"Back in his temple, Iskaral Pust realises the spiders that have been plaguing him are actually a D'ivers woman named Mogora. Mogora was aware of the misdirections but not interested in reaching the gate and ascending herself. They also witness the undead dragon leaving - apparently a T'lan Imass who came to defend the true gate in case the need arised."
132,99,"In the epilogue, a young plains pregnant woman is told her child is soulless and as she prepares to return it to the earth she faces a cloud of crows."
