1,"One of the new 'talents' that can aid us navigate a rapidly changing world is 'the capacity to let go of comfort and become accustomed to ambiguity and contradiction, to raise above convention, to reframe questions, to abandon assumptions, open to new paradigms, more imagination and less reasoning to integrate ideas, experiment and tolerate failure. Due to new findings, all these seem to form a coherent cognitive style. We'll call all this elastic thinking. Bottom-up, non-linear processing, less directed and more informed by emotional centres'. "
2,Scripted behaviours in primal life are extended with rational thinking and elastic thinking. 
3,"There are four basic traits of human temperament: reward dependence, harm avoidance, persistence, and neophilia (attraction to novelty and change). "
4,"Humans are particularly interested in the new, in exploration, compared to other species. Still, tedious tasks were the norm until very recently, and the word boring didn't even enter the vocabulary until the late 18th century and the Industrial Revolution. Our appetite for stimuli and change has grown dramatically ever since. "
5,Epigenetics is the field of studying cells modifying bits of DNA and related proteins to turn on/off genes in response to environmental changes. Epigenetics is little understood but can be driven by habits and behaviours and even be hereditary.
6,135k years ago humanity was reduced to about 600 individuals after a major catastrophe. It is theorised that the survivors had a greater edge for exploration which resulted in unpreceded explorations/colonializations from their descendants in the next few millennia. There has even been a gene found connected to explorations (dopamine-driven) that seems stronger on populations further removed from their origins. 
7,"Scripted behaviours are fairly common in humans even if often we are not aware of them. In that sense, responses are mindless as they are simple scripted responses to given triggers. In contrast, mindful responses are following some thinking which can be either rational or elastic. "
8,Research suggests that mindful practice 3-6 times a week will observably increase your ability to reduce scripted responses and raise other executive functions such as focus. 
9,The difference between making a computer that can play chess and one that can compose music is similar to the difference between analytical and elastic thinking. 
10,"Without the reward system, we are unable to take pleasure in reaching goals and therefore we are unable to reach decisions on open-ended questions like where to eat, as illustrated by a patient with an impaired reward system. Analytical thinking alone is similarly inadequate. Elastic thinking is essential whenever you need to formulate and invent criteria for choice. "
11,"Satisfiers vs maximisers. Satisfiers take the first good enough choice, while maximisers are looking for optimal choices. The maximising strategy usually leaves people depleted and less satisfied therefore only worth doing for important stuff like doctors, life partners and so on."
12,"Ants and other social insects, by following scripts, are able, in large numbers, to show signs of intelligence in organising and adapting to the environment. However, this is not directed, it is an emerging quality. Hence, it is tempting to see the colony (vs the individual) as the intelligent organism. The example is used as a metaphor for bottom-up, unorchestrated elastic thinking."
13,"Being open to personal paradigm shifts for ideas, concepts and approaches is a very useful ability in order to adapt to change. So especially important in our rapidly changing world. Try this mental flexibility exercise: write down well-held beliefs on pieces of paper and throw them in a hat, pick one up and try to argue the opposite. "
14,"Dog and bone problem: throw a bone over the fence, and the dog runs straight for it and gets stuck behind the fence. The problematic logic here is attempting to minimise physical distance - the closer to the bone, the better. Instead, the solution lies in going away from the bone and around the fence. This is minimising distance in problem space - the path needed to solve the problem. "
15,"Default mode of though: thinking without consciously focusing, a key element for elastic thinking. "
16,"In the brain, there is an association cortex for each sense and motor region. They help confer higher-level meaning. In humans, 3/4 of all brain cells are in those cortices, which is the highest percentage in animals by far. All components of the default mode reside in these cortices. Association cortices are always 'on', but are most free to roam when not consciously focusing, for instance when working, driving, showering, and so on. "
17,"Losing the ability to make associations produces the true empty mind. As displayed by patient J who was only able to respond, losing all ability to maintain a dialogue, or understand jokes. "
18,"Rest time is harder to get in modern society but essential for associations to be forged so that things can fit together and make sense. Make time for it. To this effect, even procrastination has been linked to creativity."
19,"Corpus callosum: a brain structure that connects the two hemispheres. When severed, the hemispheres act independently. One can learn things while the other remains oblivious to them. "
20,"When trying to understand a sentence we need to understand the meaning of words in context. Like a puzzle. The left brain usually processes the more straightforward meanings and the right brain the more unusual ones. Hence, the right brain is better at comprehending the unexpected, like metaphors, jokes, sarcasm and so on. A parallel can be made between moments of insight and understanding language. Insight feels spontaneous but is the product of a long (silent) process that produces and assesses unlikely solutions. "
21,"For unlikely interpretations to surface, a part of the brain, ACC, shuts down (or turns down) the left brain to let ideas from the right brain to surface. You can help this process by avoiding tackling a problem directly, focused, or logically. Basically, the production of unusual ideas requires the toning down of the usual. "
22,"If insight and creativity are driven by unusual ideas, there is a good reason to strengthen our ability to produce such ideas. To do so, we should challenge the various ways that our thinking can be rooted in the usual, becoming rigid and inflexible. "
23,"Functional fixedness is when you get stuck using an ability/tool in a certain way and are unable to see other uses or apply a skill in different contexts. For instance, as a writer to only write certain kinds of books. This is part of a more general problem, the momentum of thought problem, which is the difficulty of changing course after accumulating momentum, in this case, due to habit, repetition and so on."
24,From Keynes: this book contains a simple idea that is easy to understand. The difficulty lies in getting away from older ideas. 
25,Frozen thinking (aka dogmatic cognition) is when ideas are so old/imbedded in self that are never questioned. The process of questioning them is critical thinking. This is especially important on moral grounds (see nazi). Experts are especially prone to frozen thinking due to experience and are less open to new ideas. 
26,"Diametrically opposite to frozen thinking, is the beginner's mind, which is the ability to discard preconceptions (not experience per se) and be able to appreciate things as if you are encountering them for the first time."
27,"Experiment with chess: one board with a hard winning solution, and one board with one easy and one hard winning solution. Given time, subjects were always able to find the solution on the first board. But had difficulty finding the hard solution on the second board even though they knew it existed. They got stuck by seeing the easy solution. "
28,"Dogmatic cognition vs beginner's mind. One of the problems is that experts are socially expected to be dogmatic. Ideally, we should be looking for a breadth of knowledge/experience, combined with a beginner's mind. "
29,"Experiment with colours: a group of people asked if the slides were blue. In the experimental group, some people shouted green a few times. This didn't change the responses of the subjects. But in the following experiment, the same subjects were asked to rate colours on a blue-green scale and those in the experimental group were more likely to go towards green than those in the control group. The point is that you are influenced by dissonance/variety even if you don't agree. In this way, thinking (and for our interests, inflexible thinking) can be challenged simply by exposure to variety. This is the best argument for engaging in arguments, especially with dogmatic opponents, even if there is no hope of convincing them."
30,"The conscious mind can process around 40-60 bits of info per second (about as much information contained in a short sentence). The unconscious mind has a much larger capacity. As an example, the visual system processes about 10mil bits. Therefore, a filter is needed to only allow the most important information to reach the conscious mind. A similar filter is also present for ideas and associations. A key brain structure in filtering is the lateral prefrontal cortex. "
31,"The idea is that to get good new ideas, you need to get lots of ideas and then throw away the bad. In this sense, a critique of ideas during their production is the enemy of creativity. The aim is to reduce filtering and try to be more childlike in the sense of lacking inhibitions. The late development of the lateral prefrontal cortex means a weak idea and association filter in children and gives a clue on the development of inhibitions with age (along with other factors) "
32,"Many innovators, in music, science, or any field, are also often eccentric, more prone to hold unusual or supernatural beliefs, have wacky habits etc. All this is consistent with a more relaxed cognitive filtering. Similarly, people with some schizotypy, like offspring of shizophrenics are extra imaginative and creative. It is a delicate balance of being wacky enough to be creative but still maintain enough control to be functional. "
33,"Analytical thinking (structured, restrictive) and elastic thinking (associative, imaginative) are like different modes of thinking we can switch between as needed. Strengthening one does not mean we are abandoning the other. "
34,"THC, the active agent in cannabis, suppresses the action of prefrontal cortex filters. Therefore, it can boost elastic thinking, but problematic with people who already have a weakened filter, for instance, due to some schizotypy. "
35,Alcohol can aid elastic thinking by weakening the cognitive filter but is hard to get the dosage right. 
36,LSD and psilocybin strengthen the default network so could enhance elastic thinking but no direct experiments have been conducted yet. 
37,"Ayahuasca is another substance that can boost creativity. Curiously, the source given here is hearsay, with no research mentioned by the author. "
38,"Fatigue of the analytical brain seems to boost elastic thinking. Good to know as a trick to boost elastic thinking. Also, morning people, who are best at doing analytical work in the mornings, are better at elastic thinking in the evenings. Good to know when scheduling tasks. "
39,"Negative emotions like anger, fear and disgust are linked with certain physiological (heart rate) and behavioural (fight, flee, throw up) responses. Filters are also modified so that the free flow of ideas is restricted. It is hypothesised that positive emotions that are not linked with behavioural responses have the opposite effect, namely, encouraging us to explore environmental relationships or ideas. They also seem to promote longevity which is the basis of positive psychology. Indeed, happiness is linked with elastic thinking, but also vice versa. Solving elastic problems boosts mood. "
40,No generic recipe for creativity. Develop self-knowledge to deploy your own.
