1," In the twentieth century, there were vast differences in societies around the world. Most were literate industrial populations but there were also many farmer-based societies, and even some hunter-gatherers with stone tools. The societal differences were so vast that a handful of societies managed to overpower and exert their will in many others via expansionism, colonialism and so on. Why were they able to do so? Why and how did these differences emerge? This is what this book tries to answer. Why did societal and technological development proceed at such different rates in different parts of the world?"
2,"Explanations for the different developmental rates across the world generally fall into two categories: because of the people, or because of their environment. Not only do older attempts to explain developmental differences according to differences in populations' intelligence (the non-white Europeans being less intelligent) have no merit as no convincing proof was ever presented, but Diamond believes Westerners might actually be at a disadvantage after spending a lot of time with New Guinean aboriginals who to him seem more intelligent. He believes they might be more intelligent because 1) intelligence probably plays much more of a role in survival there compared to the Western world where people survive more indiscriminately, and 2) because kids grow up with no TV, spending their whole time talking, playing, and engaging with others, so with a lot of stimuli believed to be vital by Western scientists. So, the question becomes, why did the Europeans develop more quickly even though they might be less intelligent?"
3,"One explanation given in the past to explain developmental differences in societies is that of weather. The argument is that a varying climate pushed people to be more inventive, develop warmer clothes and homes and so on. Weather on its own is inadequate to explain these developmental differences. It's inadequate because Northern Europeans largely benefited from inventions developed elsewhere like the wheel, metallurgy, print etc, and in America, all significant inventions happened around the equator which is where the largest civilisations also grew."
4,"Another explanation sometimes used to explain these developmental differences between societies is about low land river valleys in dry climates. In such areas, farming requires irrigation control which is hard to implement so such efforts might have given rise to central government. Again, this explanation is adequate due to the various exceptions where societal developments did not follow irrigation developments, or where such river valleys never developed irrigation at all. "
5,"Guns, germs, and steel are much better at explaining the developmental differences between societies, as at least they talk about the actual means by which the Europeans dominated the rest. But we should look at how and why those things developed, and why Africa with a head start on civilisation and plenty of deadly viruses was surpassed. A good starting point to understand the impact of guns, germs and steel is to look at the spectacular story of Pizarro."
6,"The Spaniard Pizarro, along with his 168 men, received the Incas emperor Atahualpa along with his 80.000 soldiers and managed to take him prisoner, killing several thousand of his servants and soldiers in the process, without losing a single Spaniard. They kept the emperor prisoner for 8 months, extracted a ridiculous amount of gold as ransom and then proceeded to kill him instead of releasing him, further crippling the Incas empire. Sure, the Spaniards would eventually prevail due to their superior technology, guns etc, but this incident greatly sped up the process. How did they manage this? The shock factor of first seeing guns and horses probably played a role initially in their success, but according to Diamond what allowed a handful of Spaniards to repeatedly massacre thousands of Indians was the ridiculous advantage provided by their superior equipment, steel armour and weapons, guns, and horses. Their armour was impenetrable by the Incas' weapons, while their steel weapons cut easily through the Inca's defences. Even a small cavalry of a couple dozen Spaniards was virtually invincible on open ground. "
7,"Something else that helped Pizarro was that the Incas were at the time divided - Atahualpa and his army were in Cajamarca because they just won a civil war. The former emperor and his heir were both killed by a smallpox epidemic and as a result, Atahualpa and his brother fought for becoming the next emperor. The spread of disease was not only important in dividing the empire before the Spaniards arrived, germs would ultimately be responsible for wiping out around 95% of the estimated original Native American population."
8,"Europeans had a clear advantage in their Maritime ships and technologies, that allowed them to arrive in the Americas while the opposite wasn’t possible. These maritime advancements and the undertaking of these expeditions required a certain central government organization back in Spain that was very different from the ones in the Americas. A central government was also in place in the Americas but it actually played against them as the capture and extermination of the emperor effectively crippled the empire."
9,"The last inequality, that allowed Pizarro to set the trap and Atahualpa to walk into it, was one of information. Pizarro was aware of a long European history full of conflict, of other cultures, and of the most recent conquering of the Aztecs by Cortes. Atahualpa was completely unaware of the Spaniards and their prowess or of any similar historical incidents. He hadn't even heard of the fall of the neighbouring Aztecs a couple of decades earlier. This inequality ultimately comes down to writing that allows precise, fast and lasting transmission of information, even to people like Pizarro who was himself illiterate. Writing also helped the Spaniards to share information and stories effectively bringing more Spaniards to the cause. "
10,"The development of technologies such as guns, steel, and even writing, as well as the emergence of killer germs capable of epidemics are all dependent on one common factor: the population size of the societies producing them. To better understand this, we can separate all societies into 4 main categories, based on their population size, and examine their relative characteristics. These four kinds of societies are bands, tribes, chiefdoms, and states."
11,"The first population-based group is bands which consist of groups of a few tens of people, typically nomadic hunter-gatherers. These are basically extended families or a couple of extended families, who are typically egalitarian. This is pretty much how humanity started, and how our primate relatives tend to organise themselves. There are still such societies living in remote sites in New Guinea and Amazonia. Information, decisions and land are communal in such societies."
12,"The second societal group, tribes, number in the hundreds and are typically settled in one or several close-knit villages, although occasionally they also move seasonally. There is more than one kin involved but they are still all somehow related together either via family or marriage and they all know each other. They are still fairly egalitarian, with shared access to information and decision-making, but land typically belongs to one kin(clan), not all. Due to their size and static nature tribes typically develop around food production practices."
13,"The third societal group, chiefdoms, number from thousands to tens of thousands of people. With such populations, we start having significant specialisation of labour which gives rise to professional craftsmen, soldiers, bureaucrats, priests, and so on. The specialisation of labour also allows for the use of slaves. There is a clear and permanent leader, the chief, who retains the right to decision-making, for holding certain information and the privilege of violence as these groups of increasingly strangers grow larger. Chiefs stand out from their clothing and statue being generally recognisable dead or alive, and their status is hereditary so societies have classes. The chiefs receive tributes from their subjects some of which they may redistribute - the percentage of what they keep typically making them good or bad leaders.  As kleptocrats, chiefs have 4 ways to maintain power 1) keep the public happy by redistributing most of their tribute, 2) by maintaining order and preventing violence, 3) by taking away everyone's weapons (much harder in older societies), or 4) by religion with the chief being a god or at least a chosen one. Chiefdoms are also the first tier where we see public function buildings like temples."
14,"In the fourth societal group, states, specialisation of labour is even greater (hence also a greater opportunity for slavery), bureaucracy runs much deeper in multiple levels, there is typically a firm written law and law enforcement, and the leaders/kings enjoy even more privileges concerning decision making and information holding. The king is sometimes deemed divine, but in some states like many modern ones, the chief position, as well as many of the bureaucrats, is not hereditary. Many states also have official religions that apart from justifying the chief, provide some unity to the populace and a reason to literary die outside of themselves. The last one giving a great edge in war."
15,"Except for the Incas, as societies reached the level of States they also developed writing and a literate elite."
16,"Increasing population seems to be the driving force behind developing more complex centralised governments as we saw in the progression from bands to states. This complexity arises to deal with 4 principal problems: 1) conflict resolution, 2) decision making 3) redistributive economy (redistribute some goods from people who have many, to people who have a deficit), and 4) population density. These are the reasons why larger societies cannot organise themselves like bands do."
17,"The amalgamation of simpler societies (let's say chiefdoms) into more complex ones (States) is driven either by conquest or by the threat of war/conquest (for example, the Cherokee Indians coming together to face the whites). But amalgamation is much more intense with larger societies because defeated people are useful either as slaves or for paying tribute, functions that are not very useful to bands. Defeated bands are useless to other bands, so defeated ones tend to simply move a bit further away from the winners. So the move to larger societies is much easier to explain when there is at least a large population around, but it's less obvious in bands. The move from hunter-gatherer bands to food-producing tribes is even harder to explain because farming and herding don't require less energy than hunting-gathering. In fact, the change is often not clear-cut. In some cases, people started food production part-time while still gathering. Sometimes they started farming, abandoned it for a few centuries and then returned to it. Sometimes they never started it even though their neighbours were doing it. The main reasons people eventually picked up food production practices are a) decline in the availability of wild foods, b) increased availability of domesticable plants (due to climate change), c) development of technologies for harvesting, processing, and storing food, d) increased population creating a feedback loop with food production, one strengthening and increasingly depending on the other, and e) geographic boundaries. "
18,"Food production greatly helps a population grow. Because we do not eat most of the natural plants and animals (because we cannot digest them, or it's not practical to collect or eat them) in the wild, food is spread out and a hunter-gatherer needs a lot of space to gather enough calories. By farming, we can concentrate calories by a magnitude of 10 or even 100 compared to the wild, so the population can get much more dense. Animals further improve food production via meat, dairy, manure, and allowing for ploughing more land. Food-producing societies are also static and thus allow birthing children in shorter intervals as mothers don't need to carry them around. This is important because a by-product of food production is the ability to sustain non-food-producing specialists like kings and bureaucrats to lead and organise, soldiers to fight, priests to offer reasons to fight, craftsmen to develop tools and weapons, scribes to retain more information than can be accurately remembered and so on."
19,"Plants and animals domesticated for food production are not only useful in their immediate consumption. Large animals particularly help with providing manure and helping in ploughing. Consider how the old world developed mono-culture fields due to ploughing, while the new world that was lacking animals for ploughing kept relying on planting by hand producing poly-culture gardens. Beyond food production, plants aid the production of clothes and ropes, and large animals help with transportation, and of course war, with horses being the dominant assault vehicle from prehistory all the way to WW1."
20,"With food production being the driving force of increased populations, it's interesting to see where food production started and how it spread. There are at least five areas where the domestication of plants and/or animals happened independently (in chronological order): Southwest Asia, or the Fertile Crescent (wheat, pea, olive, sheep, goat), China (rice, millet, pig, silkworm), Mesoamerica (squash, corn, beans, turkey), South American Andes (potato, manioc, Lama, guinea pig), Eastern US (sunflower, goosefoot). There are four more possible candidates: Africa's Sahel zone (sorghum, African rice, guinea fowl), tropical West Africa (African yams, oil palm), Ethiopia (coffee, teff), and New Guinea (sugar cane, banana). Everywhere else, food production arrived as a package of already cultivated plants and animals, or at the very least as a known practice that drove further domestication of new species."
21,"Very common in the ancient world to combine cereals rich in carbohydrates (wheat, barley, rice, corn, sorghum, millet) with pulses rich in protein (peas, lentils, soybean, other beans) for more balanced diets. All of the early food production sites included plants from both families (in some places instead of cereals, sweet potato and yams were used as staple foods). Also, all of them, except the eastern US and New Guinea, had at least one fibre plant for clothes, ropes etc, like flax, hemp, or cotton."
22,"Regarding the origin of plant domestication, initially, it was probably plants adapting to humans, turning tastier, bigger and so on, with humans picking them up more often as a result and the plants propagating in their latrines or garbage. Later, humans started choosing their favourite plants for planting. So humans were unintentionally genetically selecting the tastier and bigger, but also the peas that don't pop down their seeds and wheat that doesn't shatter, or plants that sprout all their seeds at once, in effect reversing otherwise effective propagation techniques from the plants. Also unintentionally selecting plants able to replicate themselves (self-fertilising hermaphrodites), forcing plants to even change their replication strategies."
23,"The first plants to be domesticated around 10.000 years ago (wheat barley, peas) were productive right away, they were ready to store, required few mutations from their wild cousins and were easy to regrow. The first trees, around 4000 BC (olives, figs, grapes dates, pomegranates) provided yield a few years after planting, and could easily be replanted through cuttings and seeds. Trees that were domesticated much later, at around classical times, (apples, pears, plums, cherries) needed grafting to repopulate with unsure results, and for a lot of them, their ancestors required cross-pollination making it harder to pollinate or to find easier to cultivate mutants. Other plants domesticated at around the same time, initially as weeds, were rye, oats, turnips, radishes, beets, leeks, and lettuce. All this applies to Fertile Crescent and the wider area."
24,"14 large animals were domesticated in the ancient world. Of those 14, the 5 main ones were eventually adopted worldwide: the sheep, goat, pig, cow and horse. The remaining 9 have only useful in strict geographies: the Arabian camel, Bactrian camel, llama and alpaca, donkey, reindeer, water buffalo, yak, Bali cattle, and mithan. Animals like elephants that were merely tamed and not domesticated are not included in this list. We are focusing on large animals because they brought much more benefits beyond providing food in the form of ploughing, transportation, war and so on. The ancient fourteen were originally, very unevenly distributed geographically. There was none in North America, Australia and sub-Saharan Africa. There was only one in South America (alpaca). Leaving 13 out of the 14 species indigenous in Eurasia. Part of the issue was the extinction of big mammals in the Americas and Australia around the time humans arrived (the two events being very likely connected), for instance, there used to be horses, elephants and lions in America. "
25,"Despite having many species of large animals around, including many of the ancient 14's close relatives like zebras, bison, buffalos or various species of wild pigs and sheep, why have we not domesticated any more large animals even in modern times? Ultimately this is because they all fail in at least one of the following ways: 1) diet (carnivores or very picky eaters like the koala), 2) low growth rate (elephants, gorillas), 3) unable to breed in captivity (cheetah), 4) too aggressive or unpredictable (hippos, buffalos, zebras, bears), 5) tend to panic and run (deer and antelope), 6) they are solitary, territorial, or non-hierarchical so cannot do herds which are necessary for food production (antelope, deer, gazelle)."
26,"The question is why did food production start much earlier in certain areas than in others, and why some areas never picked up food production at all even though they are considered fertile zones by today's standards. The explanations fall into two categories, due to the environment (restricted resources) or due to the people (people failing to effectively use their environment). Diamond strongly supports that it was different environments that drove those differences and not people. To understand the question we'll compare the best-documented founder cultivation site, the Fertile Crescent, and two sites where cultivation was challenged: Mesoamerica and the Southwestern US. "
27,"The Fertile Crescent is the perfect example to appreciate how the environment greatly aided the development of food production as it had a rich selection of wild plants and animals suitable for domestication. The Mediterranean climate in the Fertile Crescent (wet winters, dry summers) allowed for a lot of annuals (plants that live a single season) that had a few key advantages: they grow fast, they are easy to store, and they have a high ratio of seed weight to biomass. Being the largest area with this climate and having a wide range of topography also helped to have a great variety of such plants to find good candidates for domestication. As an indication, consider that of the 56 grains with the largest seed-to-biomass ratio, 33 grew locally in the area. The topological diversity also helped with animals. Pigs, sheep, goats and cows were all domesticated in different parts of the area, and soon the whole area had all three of them, while other Mediterranean climate areas (South Africa, Chile, California, southwestern Australia) had none, or almost none large domesticated animals. All these meant that in the Fertile Crescent, they had a full package of carbohydrates, protein, meat, clothing and transportation. "
28,"In contrast, to the Fertile Crescent example, in Mesoamerica, available plants were fewer, the dominant candidate, corn, was harder to cultivate, and the main animals for domestication, turkey and dog weren't as rich in meat or very useful otherwise. Things in the eastern US were even worse. Although farming started around 2500 and 1500 BC, it wasn't until 500-200 BC that farming became a main source of food. Even though their founder plants were rich in protein and fat, their seeds were very small in size (one-tenth of wheat) and some caused hay fever and skin irritation making them hard to cultivate or live around. They domesticated no pulses or nuts and no animals apart from dogs. As a result, widespread agriculture and a population boom only happened after adopting the much more potent Mexican trinity (corn, beans and squash). It's indicative of their usefulness that many of the local plants domesticated were later abandoned from agriculture altogether. "
29,"The argument that certain areas failed to develop food production due to their people does not find any support from our limited knowledge of existing hunter-gatherers. Such societies, like the ones found in Papua New Guinea, demonstrate both a keen knowledge of the plants and animals of their environment and a clear willingness to apply such knowledge to improve their food intake. For instance, the natives of Papua New Guinea were quick to recognise the value of the sweet potato that came to them via the Spanish and quickly started cultivating it resulting in a population boom."
30,"The best argument supporting that the available environment, and not people, drove the development of food production, is humanity's inability to domesticate any large animals since the ancient 14, and any significant plants. Although various plants have been domesticated more recently (like the strawberry in medieval Europe, pecans and blueberries in Eastern US) these were not staple foods and did not have a significant impact on food production overall. There was no human failure, simply because the ancients domesticated all plants and animals of major importance to food production. Generalising we can say that areas where no food production was developed were severely limited in available wild plants and animals for agriculture."
31,"Up until WW2, at times of war, more people died from war-borne diseases than hostilities. The most extreme case being the conquest of America where about 95% of the pre-Columbian Native American population died from diseases (smallpox, bubonic plague, measles, influenza, typhus). The germs themselves, along with the relative immunity people got after millennia of being exposed to them, proved deadly to populations that hadn’t been exposed to them before. And often the disease preceded the arrival of the conquerors, as in the case of Pizarro. This is a story that would repeat itself in other places like Africa and Polynesia. "
32,"Epidemics are linked to food production in at least two ways. Firstly, epidemics arrived at us via livestock, via the animals we domesticated (measles, smallpox etc). Secondly, epidemics require large populations to keep going, and these populations can only be obtained via developed food production. Characteristic of all the major epidemics is that they infect people very fast (almost everyone) with people quickly either dying or gaining some immunity to the disease. In small populations, the disease dies out after a single wave. Only if a population is large enough can the disease keep infecting new people, before returning some years later to infect new non-immune people."
33,"Although Europeans brought numerous killer diseases to the Americas, pretty much no diseases were waiting for them there (with the possible exception of syphilis whose origin is still contested). This is because even though there were large population centres in the Americas, they didn't have much livestock to get diseases from, and the livestock they did have wasn't of the cuddly kind, or in very big herds or populations in general. On the other hand, Eurasia and Africa had plenty of killer diseases that proved deadly to the non-exposed natives in the new world. Ironically, the spread and establishment of tropical diseases in the Americas by Europeans proved to be one of the main obstacles against European expansion later on."
34,"Writing developed independently at least in two places: Sumeria and Mesoamerica, and at maximum, two more, Egypt and China. All other attempts at writing were influenced by those either more directly (copying words, letters) or less directly (copying concepts, ideas). All the older languages were logograms (one shape for one word), and although the Egyptians developed something like an alphabet linking each sound with a letter, they didn't widely use it. It was the Semites who initially created an alphabet-based writing language with the Greeks first adding vowels to it."
35,"While all ancient writing languages were developed around bureaucratic use cases, with few leading up to propaganda and myth, like the Egyptians, the first preserved instances of Greek (after abandoning the Mynicean and Minoan languages and becoming illiterate for a while) and Roman languages were jokes and poetry written on objects like wine cups."
36,"Certain areas never developed writing, including one of the largest empires of its time, the Incas, the Hawaiian and Tonga proto empires, subequatorial and West Africa (before the arrival of Islam), and the largest North American societies. Considering that writing almost everywhere got somewhat copied rather than reinvented the main reason writing didn't appear in all these places was primarily their isolation. "
37,"Counter to popular belief that inventions came out of necessity, much more often inventions came out of curious inventors who liked tinkering, who invented something without having a clear purpose for it, only finding a use for their invention later. Such inventions include the airplane, the automobile, internal combustion engines, light bulbs, phonographs, and transistors. The second key insight from inventions in modern times is that the heroic inventor story of someone inventing something out of thin air due to pure genius is a myth. Instead, inventions build on top of previous inventions and insights slowly improving stuff that usually are very impractical in their initial stages. This is crucial because it means inventions are seriously dependent on the availability of other inventions."
38,"Societies are sometimes not very receptive to certain technologies due to social reasons. For instance, Britain adopted electric light very late, and we are still using the ineffective qwerty keyboard. Japan dominated the electric transistor market after the patent was sold to them from the US because the US was invested in the older vacuum tube models at the time and didn’t want to produce competing products. "
39,"As many as 14 reasons have been provided by historians trying to understand why technology developed unevenly across humanity, from life expectancy to economic reasons like the availability of local cheap labour, patent laws, available training, investment returns, and strong individualism. Others are ideological, like risk-taking, the scientific outlook, tolerance to many views, and religion. And lastly, others are circumstantial like war, strong centralised governments, climate, and environmental resources. All these are useful when studying specific cases but not that much in broader studies. In practice, some cultures or tribes (like different tribes of aboriginal Americans or new Guineans) will be more receptive to technological innovation and the same culture might be more receptive in different times (like innovative Islam during the dark ages and non-innovative Islam now). So for very broad studies, we can expect technological reception to cover the whole spectrum in each continent and to be fairly random."
40,"Technology bears more technology in an accelerating feedback loop. Iron metallurgy was possible only after centuries of using malleable metals like copper and gold, after using furnaces for pottery, and spending some time experimenting with copper alloy mixes (bronze) that need lower temperatures to work than iron. Similarly, Gutenberg's printing machine benefited from developments in metallurgy, paper making, inks and so on. In contrast, consider that the wheel was invented in Mesoamerica in 3000 BC but was never used for transportation due to the lack of animals to use for the task. Apparently, the wheel of Mesoamerica and the llamas of nearby Andes never met. The development of new technology is partly dependent on the availability of other technologies in the same space."
41,"Advanced food production practices and critical innovations gave such an edge to a society that when it came in contact with other societies lacking them, these practices and inventions were pretty much guaranteed to spread. For instance, the Native American tribes most successful in putting up resistance all the way to the 19th century were the ones who adapted to using horses and guns in battle. This spread could happen in one of two ways: by the secondary society seeing and adopting the new practices, or by the first society effectively displacing the other society, for instance by war or by taking up land for food production increasing population and overwhelming the aboriginal society. The first case where practices are adopted by the Aboriginal society is cultural diffusion, the second case where the Aboriginal society is overwhelmed or even completely eradicated is population displacement. To understand which of the two took place in cases where we don't have historical records we can look at linguistic and genetic evidence. Places that weren't subjected to either cultural diffusion or population displacement were practically places that were significantly isolated."
42,"Complicated pieces of technology often are only invented once and then they are spread because reinventing them usually takes too much time. Such examples are pulleys, rotary locks, windmills, porcelain and the alphabet. So to receive such technologies a society needs to be reasonably reachable. As a result, well-connected regions, with established trade routes benefited much more from cultural diffusion. Again, Eurasia with early food production in Eastern and Western Asia and with strong trade routes benefited unevenly."
43,"When looking at food production away from the five founder areas, one of the first questions is, whether the local people were adopting the new food practices (cultural diffusion), or whether the farmers moving in displaced the locals (population displacement). The first holds true for various areas including Egypt, the Atlantic coast of Europe, South Africa, and the South-West US. In the second category certainly belong modern examples recorded by Europeans: California, the Pacific Northwest of North America, Argentine, Australia, and Siberia; all of which were still occupied by hunter-gatherers until recent centuries. The same certainly happened in more cases but the evidence is less direct."
44,"Food production spread very effectively, with hunter-gatherers only persisting in places where food production practices were unproductive (mostly in dessert and Arctic climates), or where some geographic boundary isolated them from nearby farmers/herders as in California (dessert), South Africa (different climate), and Australia (sea)."
45,"Five different sets of plants were used in food production in Africa by 1400 AD. Three of them originated in Africa, one in the Sahel zone (sorghum, pearl millet), one in Ethiopia (coffee, narcotic chat, ensete, finger millet, teff) and one in West Africa (African rice, African yams). All three are confined below the Sahara but above the equator. The last two sets are the Fertile Crescent one found in North Africa and the Chinese one found across sub-Saharan Africa. Of animals, the Guinea fowl was definitely domesticated in Africa, probably the cat and donkey, and possibly cattle, pigs and dogs. With sheep, goats, chickens and horses domesticated elsewhere and brought to Africa later."
46,"In Polynesia, there are only three domesticated animals that were all brought by settlers, pigs, chickens and dogs. Not all three made it to all islands and no additional animals were domesticated. But in any case, these animals only consisted of a smaller part of people’s diet who mostly relied on farming plants. The various plants cultivated were also brought by settlers and were all tropical plants so couldn't be effectively grown in colder climates forcing people on such islands to revert to hunter-gatherer lives. Food production was the main decider of population density on the islands. Total populations were sometimes occupying multiple close islands when travel was easy, or could be split into a single Island if there were natural barriers. Generally, large populations with high density had more of a food surplus which allowed for non-food-producer specialist classes that produced better technologies, warriors, chiefs and priests creating more complex and structured political systems with tendencies to expand, build larger monuments, ships, and so on. By the time the Europeans re-discovered Polynesia, there were already various naval empires in place."
47,"By looking at the dates when food production was adopted in certain areas it is clear that food production travelled really fast in some cases (from the Fertile Crescent in all directions, and from South China to Polynesia), and relatively slow in others (from the Sahil area south, or between the sites in the Americas). This is reconfirmed by the fact that several crops in slow-spreading areas like the Americas have more than one ancestor/source pointing to them being domesticated independently in different areas. This happened for types of beans, corn and cotton among others. If food production had travelled faster, there wouldn't be a need to re-domesticate the same varieties as was the case with all Fertile Crescent plants that were only domesticated once. The difference in speed of spread is mainly due to the South-North or East-West axes of the different continents. Eurasia which is aligned across the West-East axis allowed for a much faster spread because areas lying on the West or the East have much more similar climates, day durations etc than areas that lie on the North or South. And this allows for very much the same plants and animals to thrive, accommodates similar diseases and so on. In contrast, America and Africa spread mostly along the North-South axis, so even though food production in South-East America could benefit the Andes region in the South, the practices were hard to transfer through the very different tropical climates of Central America."
48,"General lessons we take from the New Guinean & Australian continent is that in severe isolation, small groups of people don't survive in the long run (as in small isolated islands), a population of a few thousand (Tasmania) managed to survive but lost significant technologies along the way (disappearance of fishing, bone tools, sewing clothes, starting fires), and a few hundred thousand (Australia) did much better but still seem to have lost important technologies (the boomerang in some areas, wearing shellfish, possibly even the bow and arrow)."
49,"Even though Australia was occupied almost 40000 years ago, possibly earlier than Western Europe, with evidently superior maritime technology initially, why was it still in the stone age when Europeans arrived? Australia is the driest continent with the most infertile ground and the most inconsistently changing climate. All that combined with the lack of local plants and animals suitable for domestication meant food production was never developed so it isn't a surprise populations always remained low and as a result technology never kicked off. Being severely isolated only made things worse. Australians had some chances to import technologies from their neighbours, like bow and arrow, pottery, and pigs, from the Indonesians who also had metal tools and clothes. But contacts were limited, usually with representatives with little technology themselves (hunter-gatherers from New Guinea, traders from Indonesia) who came in contact with small bands and had little effect on the overall Australian population. In fact, the only significant import of Australia since the original settlement of the continent 40000 years ago is the dog, almost certainly from Indonesia, around 1500 BC. "
50,"In New Guinea, due to its particular climate, topography, and plants, the highland region developed food production the most, along with some coastal areas, and resulted in increased populations in these areas along with the complexities that accompany it like arts, crafts and so on. Societies typically reached the tribe level there, whereas lowland New Guineans remained hunter-gathers organised in bands. The few high-altitude valleys and the inability of New Guineans to push food production to lower altitudes resulted in altitude confinement of food production (in either direction). This, combined with their low protein diet meant New Guinea never managed to reach a population of over 1 million and as a result never reached chiefdoms, and the complex centralised governments and technology correlated with them. "
51,"The Chatham Island became home to the Moriori. The cold climate didn't allow for cultivating the known crops so after settlement the Moriori reverted to older ways of life and technology and evolved into hunter-gatherer societies. This did not allow any extra food to be left for other professions. The small size of the island greatly restricted population numbers and due to the absence of soldiers, chieftains etc they resolved to peaceful solutions with male babies being castrated for population control. All this was supported by the Moriori's isolation as their small island was hard to reach and once settled pretty much evolved on its own. The Maori of northern New Zealand, on the other hand, grew plenty of crops and could afford professional soldiers, technicians etc. They lived in large settlements with political structures and often came in conflict with neighbouring settlements so were used to ongoing war. These societal differences were enough so that when the Maori heard about the Moriori lands and their peaceful ways they paid them a visit slaughtering the Moriori. Both populations had a common origin and were socially and technologically similar less than 500 years before the conflict. "
52,"China is the only one of the large nations that is not a melting pot of cultures but is instead fairly monolithic. Having one written language, only several closely related spoken ones and political unity pretty much from 221bc. If 1000 diverse languages are spoken in New Guinea with only a fraction of the population and time to evolve them that China had, one can safely assume China certainly was a melting pot at some point but has been unified for long enough to become culturally homogenised. Just as English dominated in the US and Australia over the numerous languages originally spoken there, via war and occupation, due to the advantage of earlier food production practices that gave rise to population density and technology, the same seems to have happened much earlier in China. A lot of the original languages of South China seem to have been lost, having been replaced by the main Chinese languages, while some of the South Chinese languages seem to have invaded and themselves uprooted all the local languages in modern Vietnam, Thailand, Laos and Myanmar. Similarly, the Austronesian languages that spread in the Philippines and Indonesia might have originated in mainland China."
53,"China's two large rivers facilitated East-West communications and cultural diffusion, and the many man-built North-South canals did the same. The direction of influence is mostly from North to South as reflected by the adoption of the northern writing and language. The topography helped a lot in the unification (compared to the much more rugged topography that resisted unification in Europe) and the Chinese quickly had a great advantage over their still hunter-gatherer neighbours. Studying the very few surviving hunter-gatherer tribes in East Asia it seems that not only the languages of the neighbouring areas were replaced (in Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines) but the people were also replaced by South Chinese. Aboriginal hunter-gatherers in these areas are of darker skin and have curly hair. The fact that Korea and Japan are still struggling with their inefficient, China-inherited written languages (Korea just abandoned it, Japan not even considering it) is telling of the long-lasting influence of China in the continent which started with their early food production development."
54,"Focusing too much on Europeans we tend to forget that large population movements happened among non-Europeans. For instance, East Asians occupied Indonesia and New Guinea /Australia as far back as 40,000 years ago. Then, the South Chinese were pushed out in the Austronesian expansion, managing to reach New Guinea about 3,600 years ago. The Austronesian expansion probably started from Taiwan and reached all the habitable islands of Polynesia, Hawaii and even Madagascar. It only ended in 1400 by reaching the Chatham Islands, the most remote island off New Zealand. The expansion is evident by the cultural package they carried: pigs, chickens, dogs and specific pottery, as well as by the linguistic and genetic evidence left behind. In effect, Austronesians completely replaced the populations in the whole of the Philippines and Indonesia barely leaving any traces of the original populations. But they only had a small influence in Australia due to environmental restrictions, and in the Malay peninsula and New Guinea where food production had already developed and where the Austronesians had no significant advantage. In those areas, they still left some cultural heritage linguistically and genetically but it is very thin with the aboriginals clearly dominating."
55,"Even before the colonialists arrived, Africa harboured five of the six main divisions of humanity and was home to about a quarter of all spoken languages. Africa is very diverse and had been so for a long time due to its long prehistory and diverse geography. Already from 1000 AD, Africa was home to blacks, whites, African pygmies, Khoisan and Asians. Blacks are populous in all of South Saharan Africa, whites in North Saharan Africa and both have been mostly farmers and herders. Pygmies have been hunter-gatherers living in the tropical forests of Central Africa, Khoisan have been hunter-gatherers and sometimes herders living in South Africa that were largely displaced by Europeans with only a few groups now surviving in the desserts of Namibia. Lastly, Madagascar, inhabited by Austronesians, blacks, and mixed-race people."
56,"Linguistic evidence (remnants of pygmy and Khoisan dialects in remote places) shows that both the pygmies and the Khoisan were much more widely spread but at some point were overrun by blacks. These were the Bantu coming out from Nigeria/Cameroon and the movement was old enough to sprawl about 500 dialects of Bantu, but not old enough to develop fully-fledged languages."
57,"The Bantu started in West Africa with a package of plants suitable for wet climates. Their expansion started as early as 3000 BC. They pushed into the equatorial forests displacing the pygmies and arrived on the East side where their crops had an advantage over the other African packages (from the Sahel zone and Ethiopia). On the East side, through meeting the other cultures there, they also adopted sorghum and millet, and they readopted cuttle (that they had completely lost due to tsetse flies - bourn diseases while crossing the equatorial forests) and iron tools. Iron metallurgy possibly developed in Africa independently, but in any case, steel was produced in Africa almost 2000 years before Europe. With this now upgraded cultural package, they pushed southward, largely displacing the Khoisan, all the way to the southern bit of South Africa where the climate changed and their crops weren't suitable for food production."
58,"When the Europeans arrived in Polynesia, their technological advantage allowed them to dominate the area but they only settled long term, with big white populations today, in New Zealand, Hawaii and New Caledonia, the largest islands with climates closest to the temperate European one."
59,"Papua New Guinea aboriginals managed to largely survive (instead of being wiped out by whites) because they already had some tropical diseases (imported by Indonesia) and some immunity to them, Europeans were a bit late to establish permanent settlements there (late 19th century), and the topology and fauna are so inaccessible that Europeans didn't manage to reach the fertile and populous Highlands of New Guinea until the 1930s at which point European countries were more reluctant to massacre whole indigenous populations than before. In contrast, Europeans arriving in Australia decimated most of the population in the 18th and 19th centuries via guns and germs taking over the most fertile parts of the continent and establishing food production with the Fertile Crescent package that in contrast to New Guinea it could here thrive. Aboriginals were mostly left on the western and northern parts of the continent were much less interesting and /or had some malaria. The estimated 300.000 population of aboriginals in Australia at the time of first contact was reduced to 60,000 by 1921."
60,"The European great advantage over the Americas is explained by 4 main reasons. 1) Eurasia had a significant head start of a few thousand years in developing food production, moving into tribes, chiefdoms and their associated developments in societal organisation, arts and crafts; 2) they had much better wild plants and especially animals to domesticate. Consider that in the Americas animals were never used for plowing, carrying carts, or riding people into battles. This lack of domesticated animals also had a huge impact on the lack of development of epidemic diseases; 3) they had a much weaker communication with neighbouring societies so there were much fewer opportunities to share inventions and build on top of each other. This was due to the North-South axis orientation of the continent but also due to geographical limitations; 4) and lastly, and much less importantly, they were missing some expected inventions or the utilisation of such inventions. The wheel found in pottery toys in Mesoamerica never gave rise to wheelbarrows or met the llamas of South America. South and North America never developed any writing languages."
61,"The much earlier attempted 'invasion' of Eurasia, with Vikings after colonising Iceland and Greenland, failed because Norway couldn't properly support the effort, and the climate and timing weren't right to use Eurasia's advantages - for instance establishing food production in the Arctic. "
62,"The Europeans were ultimately able to dominate and colonise Africa for the following reasons: 1) Eurasia had a significant headstart in food production, with agriculture starting earlier and with better plants than in Africa. but more importantly, all the domesticated animals in sub-Saharan Africa were imported and arrived even later; 2) the very size of the continent, especially the sub-Saharan part, is much smaller than Eurasia offering less diversity, opportunities for trading ideas, inventions and so on; 3) the North-South axis of the African continent made spreading of ideas and technologies much slower as seen repeatedly in a variety of things like domesticated animals, crops, pottery and written languages."
63,"Considering the general question of why certain people ended up with more technology and stuff than others, 4 reasons stand out. 1) the starting available material in terms of plants and animals available for domestication, 2) the main axis of culture diffusion, being much faster on the East-West axis and in places with fewer ecological and geographical obstacles (Eurasia had both), 3) the ease of diffusion between continents, with more isolated continents having a clear disadvantage, and 4) continental differences in total area and populations. Larger areas provide more variation, and larger populations offer more opportunities for innovation and cultural diffusion."
64,"Why was it Western Europe that dominated specifically, and not the Fertile Crescent? The Fertile Crescent essentially committed ecological suicide. Extended agriculture and overgrazing meant natural resources were depleted faster than they could be replaced, partly due to the poor rainfall and climate, progressively turning it into the desserts we know today that are anything but fertile. On the other hand, Western Europe's climate was much better suited to developing food production and much faster in renewing itself."
65,"Why was it Western Europe that dominated specifically, and not China? China developed food production around the same time the Fertile Crescent did, it domesticated numerous plants and animals, has recorded writing from 2000 BC, was the first to cast iron and invent things like paper, gunpowder, and the wheelbarrow. In terms of germs, China is probably where the bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza originated. This question is hard to answer, but it seems it had to do with the area’s connectedness. China is much better connected than Europe, the rivers and canals connect it much better and are much fewer significant geographical barriers. This allowed for faster diffusion and allowed China to be a leader in technology up until around 1400. But its long political unity also meant it was, and still is, much more fragile to a despot’s damaging decision. For instance, China had a great treasurer fleet that sent out great ships manned by thousands of sailors that went all around the Indian Ocean and as far as the West coast of Africa decades before Columbus set out. But an internal political conflict resulted not only in halting those expeditions but also in dismantling shipyards and effectively losing the capability to build such a fleet. In comparison, Columbus was turned down when looking for a patron for his trip but kept asking until he found some local prince to support him. It was the fifth ruler he went to. If there was a single ruler in all of Europe things might have looked very differently. "
66,"Most of what had been discussed is pretty much based on somewhat measurable environmental factors. But there are certainly other, more idiosyncratic factors at play that are much less studied. The qwerty keyboard layout was given as an example of an inefficient technology that has nevertheless persisted. The reason it came to be is already vague to most of us (some competition between some typists using different layouts in the 19th century) but the result somehow stuck and still informs ongoing technologies over a century later. Similarly, much more important decisions might have been made idiosyncratically with far-reaching effects. For instance, the adoption of conservative Confucianism in China, the importance of the proselytising of religions being the driving force of expansions of cultures that embraced said religions, the adoption of a rigid caste system in India, and so on. And to extend the argument, how much of an impact do idiosyncratic individuals have, like Hitler, Alexander the Great, Buddha, or Mohammed? "
