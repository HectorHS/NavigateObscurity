1,3,"In the prologue, Ganoes Paran, as a kid, meets a weathered soldier (Whiskeyjack) and admits wanting to become a soldier to escape the boring life of nobles. Whiskeyjack tries to dissuade him."
2,4,"Cotillion and Ammanas (Shadowthrone) are looking for vengeance against Empress Laseen to the point that Cotillion possesses a fisher girl (Sorry) to infiltrate the Malazan army ranks. They also killed everyone who happened to be around which was around 400 people including a whole cavalry regiment (175 soldiers) by unleashing the Hounds of Shadow. An old seer gives the fisher girl a prophecy right before the incident, part of which is a promise that the seer will preserve the girl in what is to come. "
3,6,Now possessed Sorry signs up for the Malazan army and specifically requests to serve under Dujek.
4,6,"Adjunct to the Empress, Lorn, visits the site of the massacre in Itko Kan. There she meets a young noble-born lieutenant named Ganoes Paran and takes him under her direct command. Lorn believes the massacre is a diversion and intends to find out what happened. Ganoes is happy to join due to the career advancement opportunities and in the hopes of uncovering the reason for the massacre and getting some revenge. "
5,9,"Outside Pale, right after the battle that concluded a 3-year-old siege, we meet sorceress Tattersail, half-dead mage Hairlock, and the ninth squad of the bridgeburners consisting of Whiskeyjack (sergeant), Kalam (lieutenant), Quick Ben, Fiddler, Hedge, Mallet, Trotts, and Sorry. "
6,10,"Sorry explains to Tattersail that the majority of the bridgeburners were deployed in tunnels under Pale which collapsed wiping out the majority of the bridgeburners. According to Sorry, Tayschrenn refused to help in the rescue efforts. "
7,10,"North of Pale, the 5th Malazan army is locked in battle against an alliance of Tiste Andii (coming from Moon's Spawn) and Crimson Guard mercenaries, led by a warlord named Caladan Brood "
8,12,"The main thing that keeps the Malazans off Pale is Moon's Spawn, a flying mountain, home to the Tiste Andii, currently solely occupied by the Moon's Spawn's lord, a suspected ancient master mage. A standoff is decided between the Malazans and Moon's Spawn, where the Malazans will throw 4 archmages (Tayschrenn plus 3 high mages he invited for the task: Nightchill, A'Karonys, Bellurdan) and a cadre of mages (Tattersail, Hairlock, Calot) against the lord of Moon's Spawn. Pale's battle concludes with Nightchill, A'Karonys, Calot dead, and Hairlock half dead. A large portion of the 2nd and 5th armies were also gone. Anomander eventually retreats with Moon's Spawn. "
9,13,"The bridgeburners believe that someone is trying to exterminate them (and Tayschrenn is part of the execution force). They also believe, along with Hairlock, that the mages were not killed by Anomander but by fellow Malazans, probably, again, Tayschrenn. Quick Ben transfers Hairlock's soul to a puppet and sets him on the trail of whoever is messing with the bridgeburners, but also attempting to uncover Sorry's true identity (who they suspect to be more than a simple recruit). There seems to be a deal that Hairlock and Quick Ben made when the former visited the latter in the mines under Pale. This way Hairlock stays with the living and can also plan his revenge against Tayschrenn. Quick Ben hands over the puppet to Tattersail with whom the bridgeburners forge an alliance. "
10,15,"A few years after last seeing him, we meet a changed Ganoes Paran. He claims his old bold honest self is almost obliterated by the layers of deception he has been practicing since meeting Lorn. He despises being a tool shaped in someone else's hands. He is afraid he is too far in to care anymore. He is on his way to join the bridgeburners as their new captain in Pale. Lorn has identified Sorry as the person of interest for their mission, and Paran is on his way to meet her. "
11,16,"Tattersail meets Bellurdan who is carrying around the decaying remains of his lover, Nightchill, in a sack. Tattersail places a spell on the remains to seal them. "
12,17,"In her first reading of the deck of dragons, Tattersail recognises the Knight of Dark (Anomander) and Oppon as the main players in the game and starts hearing a spinning coin linked to Oppon. Later, Tayschrenn confirms he knows of the spinning coin as well, and asks Tattersail to make a reading for him. An ascendant floods Tattersail's consciousness for the reading. She opens the orb, the virgin of death (who she recognises as Sorry), the Rope, Oppon (recognising they disfavour Tayschrenn) and the crown (recognised as Darujhistan). "
13,18,"Paran, being under Lorn, meets with two claws before reaching Pale, Topper (master of the claw) and later Toc the younger (part of the second army serving under Dujek). From those two he gets a bit of background about the situation in the army he is about to visit. Dujek is the commander of the army, but high mage Tayschrenn mostly runs things due to his close and often communications with the Empress. This creates tensions, and since it is clear that the soldiers are loyal to Dujek, such tensions might drive the army away from the Empire. Additionally, Whiskeyjack is a bit of a legend in the army, known to be an old commander under the Emperor, and both himself and the bridgeburners, in general, are highly regarded. Messing with them alone could cause a mutiny. All in all, a storm is ready to break. We also learn that Toc is the only claw left in all three armies (2nd, 5th, 6th) in this continent. "
14,20,"Tattersail is convinced that Tayschrenn is responsible for the death of the mages and that he could probably help avoid the tunnel collapse that killed most bridgeburners but didn't. Kalam and Quick Ben, explain they need to find out why, the details, and whether all this is driven by the Empress herself. Additionally, they share their suspicions of Sorry, her not being who she claims to be, her connection with Shadow, and even the massacre in Itko Kan. Whiskeyjack is not as confident of all the suspicions. Hairlock's purpose is to follow leads on both fronts. Tattersail agrees to help them. "
15,22,"On her third reading of the deck, Tattersail recognises that high house shadow is in the game challenging Oppon's dominance. Knight of Dark stands between them, and a clear clash between Dark and Shadow is imminent. Mason of death also has a prominent place, promising death which Tattersail worries might even be linked to herself. She has an instinct to run away but refuses to do so again. "
16,22,"Sorry attempts to assassinate Paran when he arrives in Pale, recognising him as an agent of Lorn, in an attempt to force Lorn into the fray. But due to Oppon's and Shadowthrone's interventions, Paran is spared. Oppon, the twin gods of luck, want to fester doubt in the other gods' plans (not even death is final). Shadowthrone is persuaded because he recognises Paran is used by an unknown power (Oppon), and that power tries to stay in the game keeping Paran alive. Paran argues that someone else would take his place if he dies, and Shadowthrone prefers to know who the tool of his opponent is so keeps Paran alive (but someone close to him has to die instead). Paran's now alive body gets picked up by the bridgeburners and given to Tattersail for caretaking and safekeeping. It is clear from the wounds he should be dead but isn't. "
17,23,"The ninth squad (bridgeburners) are sent to Darujhistan and Whiskeyjack sees it as a suicide mission. Dujek admits he has been pressured to disband the Bridgeburners, and offers for the ninth to simply walk away if they survive Darujhistan. Whiskeyjack turns the offer down. He seems to think there is a good chance Dujek and his army will go rogue, and he wants to be by Dujek's side when that happens. Fiddler has a feeling something terrible is about to happen, but the squad leaves Pale before anything happens. "
18,25,"Hairlock confirms Shadow had something to do with Paran's temporary death, but the Hound Gear sniffs him out and follows him to Pale where he confronts him and Tattersail. Paran wakes up and wounds him with his sword, now blessed by Oppon. Hairlock attempts to kill the hound but Tattersail kicks him out of the way allowing the hound to escape, earning the eerie of Hairlock. Tattersail falls unconscious after the confrontation and is taken care of by Paran. "
19,26,Kruppe has a dream about the spinning coin and someone finding it. He will defend Darujhistan. 26% 
20,28,"Crokus, returning from a burglary, is caught up in a war between assassins. He is almost killed by one but is saved by a spinning coin, which he picked up. They chase him but he survives. The hunters clearly state that a god intervened to prevent his killing. "
21,29,"A city watch soldier, nicknamed the Circle Breaker works for someone called the Eel. His aim is to prevent tyranny in Darujhistan. He observes councillors' night meetings and reports them to Baruk. "
22,30,"A large crow named Crone visits Baruk to extend Anomander's invitation to meet. She goes past the alchemist's barriers undisturbed. While Crone is there, a prominent member of the city council, Turban Orr, also visits Baruk offering an alliance to ensure Darujhistan's neutrality against the Malazans. Baruk declines. Both meetings signify that Baruk is a person of major importance in Darujhistan, although he holds no official title. "
23,30,"Rallick Nom, an assassin, was ready to kill Lady Simtal, but at the last minute, again with seemingly some interference from Oppon, kills a councillor instead who is accompanying the lady as part of a longer-term vengeance plan against Lady Simtal. "
24,30,"Ocelot, Rallick Nom's superior in the assassin's guild, informs Rallick of an assassin war that has started. Someone from outside the city is attacking Darujhistan's assassin's guild. They suspect it's claws from the empire. Rallick is asked to make obvious he is an assassin, to attract the hunters, whoever they are, into a trap being prepared by the assassins guild "
25,31,"Anomander offered Baruk an alliance with Moon Spawn against the Malazans. Baruk admits he is part of an influential cabal of mages. Anomander also requests from Baruk the heads of the betraying mages of Pale - stating he was betrayed by the mages, before leaving Pale and not the other way around. He was left alone in the confrontation against the Malazans and only retreated, after almost wiping out an army, to save his home, Moon's Spawn. "
26,32,"Kruppe meets in his dream K'rul, an elder god, who gifts him a fire. "
27,32,"Kruppe, Crokus, Rallick Nom, Murillio and Coll, a group of best friends who often hang out at the Phoenix Inn. Crokus notices Rallick and Murillio planning something and excluding everyone else. "
28,33,"Turban Orr is a noble, and prominent council member. He argues for neutrality against the Malazan, hoping to pave their way in and himself becoming a Fist (high Malazan military rank) or something similar. The majority for his proposition broke with Councillor Lim's assassination at Lady Simtal's balcony. All is revealed through a discussion with Simtal, with whom he has an erotic relationship. "
29,34,"Murillio secures invitations to Lady Simtal's fete after flirting with Turban Orr's wife, with the intention to go there with Rallick. "
30,35,"Crokus seems to have fallen for the D'Arle young daughter he briefly met during his last job. He informs Kruppe he changed his mind and doesn't want the loot sold, instead, he wants it back. Kruppe takes note of the peculiar coin that Crokus found on the same night with the job. "
31,36,Kruppe informs Baruk about the spinning coin and the assassin war. Baruk orders the protection of the coin bearer 
32,38,"Quick Ben travels through chaos to meet Hairlock. Is disturbed by how far Hairlock has gone, but claims he has been there before and gives a warning to the inhabitants. Hairlock has been using chaos more and more, partly to stay undetected. That and the fact that he is now a puppet add to his madness. Quick Ben gets convinced Hairlock is mad and must soon be put down before he is out of control. Leaving, he gives Hairlock a reminder he is still in charge. "
33,40,"On her way to Pale, Lorn gets ambushed in the Rhivi plain by travelling barghast. She only survives at the last minute by the intervention of Toc - who had traced her there - and of Onos T'oolan (Tool), a T'lan Imass undead warrior who was charged to meet her. Toc then brings her to Pale.  "
34,41,Tattersail awakens. Her fever was caused by Hairlock's magic (chaos). She confirms the coin has stopped spinning and has fallen. Also confirms Paran's sword is a tool of Oppon. She warns Paran against Hairlock and asks him to stay close for protection against the puppet. 
35,42,"Lorn confirms the army is close to revolting and Dujek is being pushed by Tayschrenn. She offers to support Dujek. She also verifies to Tayschrenn that they should work to eliminate all of the old guard that might still be loyal to the emperor. Then confronts him that Dujek is not one of them and they should do everything to keep him, so Tayschrenn should stay out of his way. If Dujek is forced to mutiny, it is the empire's failing, not Dujek's.  "
36,44,"Lorn confronts Tattersail, due to her childhood scars (Tattersail was part of an operation in Malaz isle to root out 'illegal' mages, the operation spiralled out of control, and many innocents died including Lorn's parents. Lorn was recruited by the claw straight after. This incident is actually what was going on during the prologue where Whiskeyjack met the younger Paran). Tattersail is ready to face the consequences. Lorn wants blood but is shut down by Dujek who reminds her she is an instrument of the empire, the adjunct. The previous Lorn does not exist. "
37,45,"In a dinner with Dujek, Tayschrenn, Lorn and Toc, Tattersail explains the hound was accidentally summoned following a reading of the deck of dragons she made, and she only survived the attack due to the interference of Oppon. She informs the others that both Shadow and Oppon have entered the fray and are interested in the Empire's plans for Darujhistan. Toc, as a claw, is asked to evaluate the truthfulness of her story, and even though he senses dishonesty, he backs Tattersail. He does so due to his commitment to the 2nd army. "
38,46,"Hairlock warns Paran and Tattersail that Lorn has a T'lan Imass companion. Paran admits that he has been working with Lorn and their mission is to take Sorry out. Tattersail suspects Lorn has additional items on her agenda, otherwise, she wouldn't need a T'lan Imass. She fears Lorn wants to exterminate the whole ninth squad and decides to travel to Darujhistan to warn them. Tattersail is worried that Paran could draw Lorn's attention, so she insists he stays behind. Paran and Tattersail become lovers.  "
39,47,"Paran meets Toc and, argues Lorn wouldn't take the bridgeburners out but Toc convinces him she probably wants to. Paran also realises that Tattersail mentioned his link with Lorn was severed when he died so there isn't a risk for Lorn tracking him down. The plan is for the two of them to catch up with Tattersail and go to Darujhistan together. "
40,48,"Tool creates an area around him that deadens magic which makes Tattersail unable to travel via warren too far. Bellurdan, still carrying the remains of Nightchill, meets her as she exits her warren with orders to return her to Pale. We learn that Bellurdan found records of a Jagut tyrant being buried/imprisoned near Darujhistan. Tattersail believes Lorn is on her way to free the tyrant which is why she is traveling with an otataral sword and a Tlan Imass. Bellurdan, on Tayschrenn's orders, refuses to let her continue, so she engulfs both of them in fire after recognising the preservation spell she had put on Nightchill's remains. Tool from further away notices the conflagration of magic and notes that something new has been born out of it which flees. "
41,49,"Crone flies to Caladan Brood to give news that Oppon are in the game and the spinning coin has been found by someone. Explains that Anomander would want to take Oppon out of the game, but Caladan Brood wants the coin-bearer protected, and hints he might use the crimson guard to do so.  "
42,49,Paran and Toc encounter the burned remains of Tattersail and Bellurdan. Toc notices small tracks leading away from the site as if something fled. Paran blames Tayschrenn and Lorn for this and vows revenge.  
43,51,"In another dream, Kruppe meets Pran Chole, a bonecaster of the T'lan Imass, a heavily pregnant Rhivi woman and K'rul. K'rul has been guiding the soul of Tattersail who is now trapped in the body of Nightchill and summoned the rest to aid him. The plan is to get her reborn as a Soletaken (a shapeshifter).  "
44,53,"Crokus meets his uncle Mammot, who is a historian and is intrigued by the idea of studying and becoming known in the upper social classes of Darujhistan, having the young D'arle in mind. Mammot also informs him how Darujhistan was founded - born from a rumour. Rumour had it that a Jaghut (one of the elder races) was buried nearby, and people flocked the hills in search of his tomb and hidden riches. The tomb was never found, but the settling camps grew into a city. "
45,54,"In Darujhistan, Whiskeyjack splits his squad into two teams with two objectives. Kalam and Quick Ben are to contact the local assassin's guild and offer a contract for the city's rulers. This seems to be standard procedure for the Empire. The rest of the squad is to take the guise of street workers and start planting mines on major intersections of the city.  "
46,54,"Sorry marks Kruppe as someone important and follows him. Kruppe leads her to the Phoenix Inn. where she murders the guard to get in undisturbed and is marked as having done so by Crokus, Meese and Irilta. Sorry notices that Crokus is the coin-bearer.  "
47,57,"Quick Ben manages to enter the Shadow realm from chaos and meet Shadowthrone. He strikes a deal to be freed from the Rope's promise of death (because he left Shadow cult) in exchange for giving Shadowthrone his quarry, Hairlock, at a time of his choosing. Shadowthrone agrees, and only later realises that Quick Ben actually is Adaephon Delat, an ex-high priest of Shadow, and has therefore been tricked. "
48,57,"Crone informs Baruk that two powers from the North are headed for the hills near Darujhistan and asks what might be there of interest. Baruk informs her of the buried Jaghut legend. He then charges Kruppe, Murillio and Rallick to go to the area remaining undetected to observe. They are to take the coin-bearer (Crokus) with them to keep him safe, but if his luck turns they are charged with killing him. "
49,60,"Sorry follows Crokus as he revisits the D'Arle estate to return the stolen goods. Crokus meets the young daughter, Challice, introduces himself and vows to get properly introduced as a suitor in the future. She laughs and he leaves before he gets caught. As he leaves, he notices Sorry watching him.  "
50,60,"Sorry marks Rallick as an assassin during her visit to the Phoenix Inn and informs Kalam and Quick Ben about him. They make initial contact and following Rallick, Kalam and Quick Ben are drawn into an assassins' guild trap originally set for the Tiste Andii assassins who have been attacking the guild. The Tiste Andii descend as the trap closes aiming to dispose of all of them, guild and malazans alike. Quick Ben and Kalam manage to fight off a couple of Andii and summon one of Tayschrenn's demons to cover their retreat. The demon is killed by Anomander. "
51,60,"We get a glimpse of how Rallick feels he is trapped in the assassin's life, with no real choices for his future, regarding his revenge plan as a last act of humanity. Coll used to be a lord, stripped of his rank and riches by his then-wife, Lady Simtal, so Rallick and Murillio are planning to take vengeance.  "
52,63,"Anomander visits Baruk and explains that he has been going after the local assassins guild. He has been afraid that the empire might try to contact the guild to attempt to wipe out the true rulers of Darujhistan - the cabal of mages that Baruk leads. The empress is known to follow such tactics and to reward handsomely assassin masters. Baruk is angry that Anomander did not consult him on this - he believes the guild is useful and shouldn't be simply wiped out - but at the same time admits that Vorcan, the assassins guild master, is very capable and a true threat to the cabal if she chooses to become an enemy. "
53,64,"Tool and Lorn discuss what comes next. They plan to find the burrow of the Jaghut tyrant and set him free. Because the tyrant was entombed with elder Jaghut magic, he has stayed out of reach of humans with their 'younger' magics. Tool is able to free him because his magic, Tellan, is of a similar flavour/time to Omtose Phellack. The tyrant is supposed to be very powerful and could very well end up enslaving the whole continent. Tool has been chosen for the mission because he is clanless, and therefore if he is enslaved the tyrant would not have access to any kin of his. In a sense both Tool and Lorn are expendable. The gamble is that Anomander will be forced to step in to stop the tyrant, which he should be able to do so but will cost him greatly and leave him weakened. "
54,64,"From two successive scenes, we get the same information. First is in one of Kruppe's dreams where he speaks with K'rul, and the second is the conversation between Lorn and Tool. We get expositions of how powerful and old Anomander is and the sword that he is carrying, and a warning that the Jaghut tyrant is of comparable power. "
55,66,"Lorn is now convinced that freeing the tyrant is wrong in the greater scheme of things but will continue nonetheless as she is merely a tool of the empress. As she wanders around the burrow (waiting for Tool to open the way), she stumbles upon the group of Kruppe, Crokus, Coll and Murillio. Surprised, she charges them, wounding Coll severely, leaving Murillio and Kruppe unconscious before agreeing to Crokus to leave them be if they leave the area. "
56,67,"Hairlock, who follows Lorn's footsteps, believes he is being pursued and sets a trap for his pursuers who happen to be Paran and Toc. Toc vanishes in a portal Hairlock opens. Quick Ben intervenes, grabbing the opportunity to betray him (informing Sorry of his location) and the Hounds of Shadow are set upon him. Hairlock gets devoured by the hounds, who then turn upon Paran. Anomander intervenes after being informed by Crone and saves Paran from the hounds without realising he is Malazan. Demands that Shadow completely retreats from the area, and by killing two hounds Shadowthrone is forced to comply and forcefully pulls Cotillion out. Anomander realises the link of Paran with Opponn, informs Paran that Oppon's influence only extends to his sword, and advises him to get rid of the sword if his luck turns. "
57,68,"Paran touches the hounds' remains and is somehow transferred inside Dragnipur (Anomander's sword). The inside is like a massive carriage carried by numerous beasts and people all chained to the carriage. He is recognised as kin to the hounds and manages to get the two hounds who are also chained, to escape through a Kurald Galain gate at the carriage using unwilling Oppon as bait. Returning to the Rhivi plain, Paran notices the bodies of the hounds are now gone. "
58,69,"Tool recognises Lorn's second thoughts and shares them, and like her, feels compelled to finish the task at hand. He says completing the task would free him from his vows and will therefore leave this place and offers Lorn to accompany him. "
59,70,"Sorry decides to kill the coin-bearer and follows the group outside Darujhistan, but at the last minute Cotillion is pulled out due to Anomander's intervention. Now lost, she stumbles upon Crokus and Coll. Coll believes the girl was previously possessed and thinks it important for Crokus to take the girl straight away to his uncle Mammot. On the way, Sorry is renamed to Apsalar as she does not remember her old name. "
60,70,"As soon as they awake, Kruppe and Murillio leave in pursuit of Crokus. Kruppe unveils that Crokus is the coin-bearer and needs to be protected. However, they lose all sense of urgency once they arrive in Darujhistan. Coll, who is too injured to travel, remains behind to recover. "
61,71,"Paran encounters a group of Rhivi warriors who attack him, but miraculously he manages to parry 5 spears with his sword Chance, before the Rhivi give pause. A small 5-year-old-looking girl tells the Rhivi to stop and tells Paran that the woman he thought dead isn't and that they will meet again soon. Paran recognises the girl as Tattersail. "
62,74,"Although Anomander recognises the Tyrant as a threat, he admits to Baruk that he has allowed Lorn and Tool to enter the burrow to free him. His rationale is that it's better for Darujhistan to deal with this threat while Anomander is around than not. "
63,74,"Anomander explains how the Tiste Andii are struggling to find the will to carry on with life, and have been borrowing worthwhile causes from others to find some meaning. Like mercenaries of the soul. He also explains that duty to his people drives him and why they would never betray their allies. "
64,74,"Baruk requests Mammot to investigate the tyrant's burrow. Mammot, a high priest of D'rek, travels via warren there and gets trapped due to the many magic and anti-magic powers layered in the area. After some time he manages to return, seemingly unscathed, and attends Simtal's fete. "
65,74,"Crokus fails to find his uncle but meets Meese and Irilta who offer to help and hide Crokus as he is wanted for the murder of a D'Arle guard who was previously murdered by Sorry. The two women are working for the Eel and tasked to protect Crokus. Apparently, Challice, the only one who witnessed Crokus' visit, betrayed him, and Crokus gets disillusioned. However, he gets determined to meet Chalice face to face to confront her and escapes Meese and Irilta to do so. "
66,77,"Circle Breaker informs Rallick that Turban Orr, representing Simtal, has offered a contract for the death of Coll. Ocelot, who is Rallick's superior in the assassin's guild, accepted the offer. Rallick rubs otataral dust on his skin to get protection from Ocelot's magicks, tracks Ocelot down and kills him. He gets injured, but otataral seems to have some healing effect on him. "
67,77,"Paran meets a heavily wounded, and alone, Coll outside Darujhistan. become friends and travel together. Coll's health deteriorates, but Paran saves him by delivering him to the Phoenix Inn and having Mallet cure him. "
68,78,Paran meets the bridgeburners in the Phoenix Inn (Kalam is visiting attempting another contact with the assassin's guild). He shares information about Tattersail and Hairlock. He warns them that Lorn wants them dead and that he seeks vengeance for her schemes.
69,80,"Whiskeyjack reveals a contraption used for direct communication with Dujek. They reveal that Dujek's army is on the verge of revolt and they plan to split out from the Empire to go after a completely different threat called the Pannion Seer. Paran wonders why they are still going after Darujhistan if they plan to liberate the continent from Malazan rule. He realizes, a headless and hurt Darujhistan could be the perfect place for someone like Dujek to seize power, and then perfect for financing his substantial army on what is to come. Whiskeyjack tells him if he wants to join, he needs to forget about Tayschrenn - he will meet his demise sooner or later, but probably far away, and also that he cannot touch Lorn in the immediate future because she has a role to play. Paran seems to agree and stays in the Phoenix Inn, hidden from Lorn. "
70,81,"A mechanism to track the passing of years was donated to Darujhistan a thousand years ago by Icarium. Each year is given a new symbol. The year that is just starting (hence the celebrations, the fete, etc) is the year of the moon tears. Icarium back then was accompanied by a Trell, and Anomander later on confirms he was visited by Icarium, Mappo and Ossric 800 years ago. Anomander comments that Icarium's gifts always have significance. "
71,82,"Circle breaker, covering for another, is staying watch at the city gates and recognises Lorn when she arrives. He also offers to cover for another to attend Simtal's Fete as a guard later that day. "
72,83,"When Lorn finds the bridgeburners, the squad is in the middle of a card game led by Fiddler and played with a deck of dragons. Fiddler is basically having a deck of dragons reading via the game. She proceeds to take control of the squad but only ends up validating Whiskeyjack's plan. They are still trying to make contact with the guild, if they don't in the day, they will detonate the mines and get out. They will also try to attend Simtal's fete where they might get the chance to take several nobles out. "
73,83,"Serrat, Anomander's second in command, is tracking Crokus and ready to set an ambush when she is ambushed herself. Wakes up hours later with her weapons nearby. She gets sidetracked again, and the third time it is revealed that it is crimson guardsmen (Cowl) who have been ordered by Caladan Brood to keep the coin-bearer alive. Serrat is forced to retreat in anger. "
74,84,"Lorn and Tool free the tyrant. Lorn identifies an object that contains much of the tyrant's power, the Finnest, and steals it to make the tyrant follow her. She plants it in Simtal's garden to draw the tyrant there. "
75,86,"Murillio thinks Kruppe is the Eel, confronts him and gets sidetracked. Baruk arrives at the same conclusion and introduces him as such to Anomander. "
76,87,"Kruppe gives a message to Circle Breaker, telling him it's time to retire. "
77,87,The bridgeburners recognise Anomander at the fete and start preparing to blow up the estate. 
78,88,"Turban Orr convinced that some spy is sabotaging his plans, finally sees Circle Breaker, remembers him from the night shift at the despot barbican, and finds his spy. But is interrupted, and then insulted, by Rallick. Orr proclaims a duel and is killed by Rallick. "
79,88,"Murillio distracts Simtal at the time of Rallicks and Turban Orr's duel. Once the duel is done, Rallick finds them, announces Turban Orr's death, and its significance for Coll, and leaves with Murillio. Murillio leaves a dagger for Simtal to take her own life "
80,89,"Raest exits his tomb to be met by 4 black dragons (Tiste Andii Soletaken) and the red dragon Silanah. He fights with them for a long time, slowly winning, although his body gets almost entirely broken. At a last stand-off with Silanah, he is drawn into a dream by Kruppe. Tool has been summoned by Pran Chole and the help of K'rul, to fight Raest. K'rul gives him the option to die here by Tool, or travel with him to the gates of chaos. Raest escapes by abandoning his body and finding another "
81,90,"Crokus finds and confronts Challice. it seems that she didn't betray him after all. Her father got a seer and was told that a woman, an instrument of the Rope, did it. She then proceeds to dismiss Crokus' approaches. Meanwhile, Apsalar is left behind in the garden where she is found by the bridgeburners. They recognise her as dis-possessed and help her heal by aiding the seer inside her."
82,91,"Rallick is met by Vorcan and brought into a part of Simtal's garden where a weird box-shaped wooden thing is growing. His otataral seems to affect it by slowing its growth. He is ordered to stay there by Vorcan. There they have an audience with the bridgeburners (Kalam had left a message with the Phoenix Inn bartender, requesting an audience with the guild master). Vorcan personally accepts the contract for the lives of the cabal mages and sets off for the hunt. Crokus witness the exchange and is later encouraged by Rallick to go and warn Baruk and Mammot who might still be at the fete. "
83,92,"Paran stumbles into a different dimension, and meets Tool who is fighting with an apparition of the Finnest. He asks for Paran's help, and Paran manages to avoid enslavement due to the hound's blood inside him defining enslavement and giving him power. They fight the Finnest long enough to allow the azath to grow enough to take it. "
84,93,"The bridgeburners (most notably Quick Ben and Hedge), along with the witch Derudan, face possessed Mammot and weaken him enough for the azath to claim him. Whiskeyjack's leg gets shattered in the process."

86,93,"Once the fight with Possessed Mammot is over, Fiddler and Hedge head out to detonate the mines. Kalam realises that the whole of Darujhistan is powered by some natural gas and that by blowing up the intersections, the whole city will blow, so hurries after them to stop them."
87,95,"Lorn admits she was working towards the death of Whiskeyjack. She aims to kill Crokus to retrieve the coin in the hopes of using it to manipulate Oppon. She sets a Galayn lord free to face what she hopes to be a weakened Anomander and then sets after Crokus. She comes against crimson guardsmen, fights with Blues and taking heavy wounds retreats only to be found, and killed, by Irilta and Meese. Paran meets her as she is bleeding out and takes her otataral sword."
88,96,"Anomander and Baruk leave the fete right after the duel and miss the confrontation with possessed Mammot. Anomander takes to the streets, attempts to scare people away and finds a vantage point to await the empire's next move, the Demon lord. Both fight as dragons for a while (both are soletaken), and eventually land and destroy part of Baruk's garden and walls. They assume their normal forms and Anomander kills the demon, but only after getting wounded himself. He urges Crokus who is nearby to go to Baruk who is in danger. "
89,97,"Crokus witnesses the death of his uncle Mammot and then hurries on to Baruk's house. Vorcan kills a couple of members of the cabal and then comes after Baruk who is with Derudan.

"

Kalam and Fiddler decide to return Apsalar home, and everyone else to return to Dujek.  "
91,98,"Vorcan, hunted by Tiste Andii seeking revenge for the death of Serrat (who was protecting Baruk), arrives at the azath barely conscious and is carried inside by Rallick. Korlat, who leads the pursuit, decides to stop the hunt and not fight against the newborn Azath. "
