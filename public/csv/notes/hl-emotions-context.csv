1,What we commonly call stress is at the heart of whether our internal experience matches our external experience.,podcast_10,00.05.25
2,"Stress can both inhibit and support our immune system. Similarly, being alert or relaxed can be helpful or unhelpful in different contexts.",podcast_10,00.06.00
3,"Stress is a generic system, it was not designed for one thing in particular (like predators chasing us), so it remains current, however much our environment might have changed. The tools to destress are also generic and are not dependent on the source of stress. If you are alive, there are tools you can use to distress, and they work.",podcast_10,00.10.33
4,"Stressors are the things that stress us out, whereas stress is our response to stressors. Stressors can be physiological (like cold) and emotional (like having an exam).",podcast_10,00.15.00
5,"The stress response starts with the sympathetic chain ganglia (a chain of neurons at the centre of our body) which release acetylcholine on activation. Acetylcholine is typically used to move muscles in the body or for focus on the brain. Then, post-ganglionic neurons react to acetylcholine and release epinephrine (which is equivalent to adrenaline). So whenever we are getting stressed, epinephrine is released in certain areas of the body, and this is a very fast process. Epinephrine activates certain receptors to prepare the body in case of need, like getting extra blood to large muscles like the legs and the heart, while also activating other receptors leading to the contraction of blood vessels in other less needed systems like digestion and reproduction. So the stress response has two faces, supporting certain systems and suppressing others. For instance, the salivary glands are one of the systems that get suppressed which is why we often have a dry throat when stressed.",podcast_10,00.16.00
6,"Overall, stress makes you want to move. It creates a bias for action, whether that is physical action, or saying something. Suppressing this urge by trying to stay still can often lead to tremors which are normal.",podcast_10,00.20.20
7,"While the sympathetic system is driving our stress response, the parasympathetic system drives our calming response, so the best ways to calm ourselves down involve tapping into the parasympathetic system. The parasympathetic nervous system sits at the neck and lower brain, and at the genitalia areas. The best way to access it is via the mouth, throat and eyes, as we have easy and fast access to them.",podcast_10,00.21.47
8,"Breathing can be used to change your heart rate. When you inhale, the lungs get dilated opening up some space for the heart. The heart having a bit more space moves blood a bit slower (the same amount of blood moving through a larger area). The sinoatrial node in the heart registers how much blood moves in the heart, informs the brain that blood moves slower and the brain tells the heart to speed up as a result. What all this means in practical terms is, that you can make your heart go faster by inhaling longer and harder compared to the exhale. The opposite is also true (longer exhales for lowering heart rate).",podcast_10,00.26.20
9,"As part of our stress response, the millions of little sacks in our lungs get compressed, leading to a build-up of carbon dioxide in our body, which contributes to our agitation while stressed.",podcast_10,00.32.00
10,"There are three kinds of stress: short-term stress lasting up to a few days, medium-term stress lasting up to several weeks and long-term stress.",podcast_10,00.40.31
11,"We are generally told that stress is bad, but stress can also be beneficial in the short term. Stress primes your whole system for better cognition, movement, and strengthens your immune system. For example, stress often arrives due to an infection and the stress response is very good at combating those, as the adrenaline release triggers the release of killer cells, primarily from the spleen, that help combat infections. Even the initial treatment of an injury like a cut benefits from stress via increased inflammation.",podcast_10,00.41.19
12,"If you have ever experienced falling sick after a long stressful period, it's probably because the decrease of stress and associated adrenaline probably crashed your immune system as well.",podcast_10,00.52.54
13,"Deliberate hyperventilation, as achieved by Wim Hoff breathing, Tummo breathing or some other super oxygenation protocol can lead to short-term stress, so it will make you more alert and better at combating incoming infections. This was aptly demonstrated in experiments where participants following such protocols displayed no or very little symptoms following an injection of toxins, compared to the very unpleasant symptoms experienced by the control group. The experiment was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences for the USA.",podcast_10,00.45.49
14,Stress is a powerful nootropic. Procrastinators often rely on stress to get things done. Stress combined with good sleep is the best nootropic you can find.,podcast_10,00.52.11
15,"So, short-term stress is good for so many things, the important thing is to be able to turn it off when you don't need it any more. As a rule of thumb if you are having trouble falling asleep then you are probably passing the threshold from acute to chronic stress.",podcast_10,00.52.45
16,"Long-term practices to manage stress, like breathwork, meditation and so on, are great but it's also useful to have real-time tools you can use to manage stress when it happens. It is extra useful if the tools are based in physiology, instead of psychology, as it is quite hard to control the mind with the mind, especially when we are in a state of very high (stress) or low (sleepyness) activation.",podcast_10,00.33.30
17,"The physiological sigh is something we naturally do when falling asleep or when crying hard and is our best-known tool for reducing stress in real-time. It consists of a double inhale (ideally from the nose) and a long exhale from the mouth. The long exhale lowers the heart rate. The double inhale helps decompress the sacks in the lungs, making the exhale even more efficient. The sigh also has some other positive side effects. With the double inhale we activate the parafacial nucleus which has been developed to help with breathing while we speak. The nucleus also sits near neurons that control the face, jaw etc, so by activating the area we also get a more general relaxation to our face, better control of our jaw and tongue, can speak clearer and so on. This is the parasympathetic system in action.",podcast_10,00.29.40
18,"The brain is connected with the diaphragm via the Phrenic nerve. This is a great system where you can control your diaphragm whenever you want, unlike other internal organs like your pancreas, spleen etc, while the diaphragm will still work fine in the background when we are not thinking about it.",podcast_10,00.30.25
19,"The vasovagal response is when your heart rate drops too fast causing you to feel dizzy or even faint. It often happens when we stand up suddenly in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, or when seeing blood or something that stresses us out. In the latter case, it is not extreme stress that causes it, it's actually the over-activation of destress mechanisms in response to that stress which lowers our heart rate too fast. The bottom line is, the physiological sigh works fast, and you don't want it to work any faster.",podcast_10,00.35.02
20,"Medium-term stress is very much related to our stress threshold, which is our ability to reregulate what is going on in our body. Extending the threshold can help us better manage what we have taken on and essentially reduce our stress. The ways to extend our stress threshold involve using techniques to activate acute stress and release adrenaline, like breathwork, or some external stressor like cold exposure. Through such a practice, let's say cold exposure, you release adrenaline and sit there learning to be emotionally and cognitively ok at that state instead of going into panic mode. We learn to relax the mind while the body is very activated. A good way to practice this is to bring your heart rate up (by cold exposure, exercising, breathing), notice how the stress response results in having more of a tunnel vision, and then try to broaden your vision. This will not reduce the stress but should bring some mental calmness that after repetition should make you feel more comfortable in these high-activation states. This is practically a rise in one's stress threshold.",podcast_10,00.55.22
21,"HRV (heart rate variability) is good, you want variability in your heart rate throughout the day or across days. You don't want your heart rate to be chronically low or chronically high. Having chronically high heart rate leads to heart disease which is one of the reasons why chronic stress is so bad.",podcast_10,01.04.44
22,"Chronic stress is clearly bad. To avoid chronic stress sleep well, exercise, and have quality social connections. Social connections in particular are not only important in promoting well-being via mechanisms like the serotonin system, but also via inhibiting tachykinin which is secreted when socially isolated.",podcast_10,01.06.01
23,"Serotonin generally gives us bliss and makes us feel good, with side effects being reduced affect. Serotonin is connected to social connections. Friends, pets, and all kinds of connections are associated with the serotonin system. See Robert Sapolsky for more on this. Social connections can really help with chronic stress.",podcast_10,01.08.59
24,"Oxytocin is also important, but much less so than serotonin, partly because it's so much harder to get. You only get it through very strong connections, like a couple right after sex, or mother-baby breastfeeding.",podcast_10,01.08.15
25,"Social isolation and the feeling of not being connected enough have been related to the release of tachykinin in all kinds of organisms, from insects to humans. This molecule is connected to long-term stress, and has negative effects both by inhibiting good stuff like our immune system and promoting bad stuff like irritability, fearfulness, and paranoia.",podcast_10,01.13.27
26,"Melatonin is a hormone telling you how much darkness you have been in. Melatonin helps you fall asleep. The supplementation dosages are usually very very high, and Huberman does not recommend it. People who use it chronically can reduce their stress, but it can also lead to reduced adrenal output which can be problematic in the long run. There is no such thing as adrenal burnout, but there is adrenal insufficiency syndrome which causes adrenals to not produce sufficient adrenaline. Taking melatonin in high doses for too long can suppress cortisol and epinephrine release producing a pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome.",podcast_10,01.18.03
27,"L-theanine is a supplement that helps many with sleep, reduces anxiety and helps with task completion stress.",podcast_10,01.21.07
28,"Ashwagandha lowers cortisol and anxiety. Huberman would take it when he is failing to manage his medium-term stress effectively, but not all the time.",podcast_10,01.23.33
29,"Emotions are context dependent. When our level of stress or calmness is matched to the demands on us we tend to think that this is good and when there is a mismatch we think it is bad. So if you have a lot to do and feel tired then this is not very good. But if you are tired and you are going to sleep then it feels good. Emotions of course are much more complicated than this, but this is a good framework to start with. ",podcast_10,01.27.04
30,"Chemicals in our bodies that have a big impact in our emotions are supported by systems where the brain and body interact, so emotions are body-brain events. Nutrition, the food we digest, has been shown to have a significant impact in those systems, which is why it is important to talk about nutrition when studying emotions. This will not only give us a better understanding of emotions themselves, it will also provide us with tools that will help us manage or alter our emotions.",podcast_11,00.06.24
31,"Emotions can be broken down into two basic categories: attraction and aversion. A pull-push dichotomy. Broadly speaking when we are attracted we tend to lean in, and breathe in more, while we do the opposite for aversion. These are the better examples of the universality of emotions. As both of these categories of emotions are intimately connected with motion, it becomes clear that when we are talking about emotions we should be looking at systems that tap both into the brain (subjective experience) and the body (movement) at the same time.",podcast_11,00.08.24
32,"The vagus nerve is one of the main ways that the body (stomach, heart, lungs, gut, immune system etc) and brain connect, and is important in controlling emotions. The vagus nerve sends sensory information to the brain (your heart is beating this fast, your stomach is that full, or there is that much acidic food in your stomach), and also sends motor information from the brain to the body. So the vagus nerve is involved in informing the brain what is going on in the body, what to feel regarding that, and what to do in response.",podcast_11,00.12.48
33,Separating the vagus in polyvagal theory to explain things like this person is lethargic or this person is flexible because this part of their vagus is hyperactive has no base in science.,podcast_11,00.16.40
34,"There are gut neurons that when detecting sugary or fatty food in the gut, send information to the brain via the vagus nerve, and the brain releases dopamine, which basically creates a craving for what you just ate and has nothing to do with the taste of the food itself. This is an actual example of a gut feeling and an example of a process that drives actions without us consciously understanding what the process is. This also means that if you eat something very salty, which contains sugar in it that you cannot taste because the saltiness overwhelms the sweetness, you will crave that food because of the sugar. So sugar is not just problematic for disrupting blood glucose levels, or in relation to obesity in general, it is also disrupting our dopamine systems.",podcast_11,00.18.25
35,"The locus coeruleus in the brain releases noradrenaline when preparing for a meal, sometimes experienced as stress or excitement about eating, and activates the lateral hypothalamus which inhibits feeding, making you want to eat less. Once we eat and digestion starts then we start relaxing.",podcast_11,00.23.10
36,"We feel full when the gut tells us there are enough amino acids (in quantity and variety), which is independent of how full the stomach is. Amino acids are also the building blocks of muscle and neurochemicals in the brain.",podcast_11,00.27.31
37,"Dopamine is released when we are excited, or when things we are looking forward to work out. Dopamine release is inhibited by events we are looking forward to and do not work out - the so-called reward prediction error. You can really set up too high expectations on the chemical level, and unless the expectation is met, the brain releases less dopamine than it would normally release by the same input (food, event etc). And this does not only have an impact on the individual experience but can also inform the things that you pursue.",podcast_11,00.29.08
38,"Dopamine is not just the molecule of reward, it is the molecule of desire. An increase in dopamine also increases mood to the extent that there is a whole category of antidepressants that concentrate on lifting dopamine.",podcast_11,00.31.40
39,"The amino acid l-tyrosine that comes from food is a precursor to dopamine, which means it helps in increasing dopamine production. Such foods will create cravings, make us want to do more of what we are doing and raise mood and motivation in general. You can take l-tyrosine as a supplement to boost dopamine production but chronic use can disrupt dopamine pathways so should be avoided. If taken infrequently it can create a small crash of brain fog and lethargy a day or two after use.",podcast_11,00.31.51
40,"Parkinson's disease is a depletion of dopamine, which is why patients take l-dopa to increase their dopamine production.",podcast_11,00.33.03
41,"Methamphetamines and cocaine are so terrible because they rump up the system with dopamine so much that you cannot achieve dopamine release without them. Obviously, they are also very addictive.",podcast_11,00.35.15
42,"Dopamine is motivation, and motivation is generic. If we get dopamine from something we eat we will not only be motivated to eat that same thing egain, we will also be motivated to keep doing whatever activity we might be doing at the time or what led us to this food.",podcast_11,00.37.23
43,Serotonin is about feeling content and comfortable. So it is antithetical to dopamine which is all about pursuit and motivation.,podcast_11,00.38.33
44,"There is this general idea that eating a big meal leads to a rest and digest state which releases a lot of serotonin and makes us feel satiated. This is partly true, but also, much more complicated. To begin with, there is a lot of serotonin in the gut, but most of what regulates your mood sits in your brain.",podcast_11,00.39.31
45,"Carbohydrate-rich foods and turkey will raise serotonin, mainly because they are rich in the amino acid tryptophan. Meat and other fatty low carb foods will increase dopamine. Huberman likes eating things that boost his dopamine earlier in the day, and foods that boost serotonin later in the day.",podcast_11,00.43.31
46,"5HTP is a precurssor of serotonin, so supplementing with 5HTP can increase serotonin but can create problems in the natural production of serotonin, so be careful of long-term use. They also tend to decrease appetite.",podcast_11,00.44.28
47,"Serotonin is related to feeling satiated, and it goes both ways. Eating foods makes us feel satiated, but also when we have a lot of serotonin we will not look for food.",podcast_11,00.46.45
48,"Mucuna pruriens is a bean with serotonin on its surface, and l-dopa inside the bean. It reduces prolactin, increases testosterone, and promotes well-being.",podcast_11,00.47.55
49,"If you are very anxious and active, you might not want to lean on the dopamine system too much and look into leaning into the serotonin system instead. On the other hand, if you are passive and miss motivation you might want to lean more into the dopamine system. The best way to make such changes is via behaviours, and nutrition is an important such behaviour.",podcast_11,00.54.27
50,"Our omega-3 to omega-6 ratio has a profound effect on mood and depression with more omega 3's significantly improving mood. In a study, it was shown that 1000mg of EPA (part of omega-3-rich foods like fish oil) was as effective in treating depression as 20mg of Prozac. Furthermore, the two effects can be combined. People with high omega 6 ratios that were given omega-3's not only lowered their inflammation markers but also became more responsive to depression medication, and all that happened via improving heart rate variability. This comes from a study published in Aust N Z J Psychiatry on 2008: ""Comparison of therapeutic effects of omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid and fluoxetine, separately and in combination, in major depressive disorder"".",podcast_11,00.56.39
51,"The dosages of omega-3 discussed here are typically very high to be ingested by food alone, so supplementation is usually necessary. Apart from fatty fish, omega-3s can be found in krill, chia seeds and some other seeds, and in meat if the animal has crazed a lot on omega-3-rich grasses. There is a danger that omega-3 supplements contain a lot of heavy metals from the fish, so make sure it's de-contaminated. There is also the danger the fish oil has gone rancid, you can usually tell by the taste (can chew the capsule if taken in capsule form).",podcast_11,01.02.47
52,"L-carnitine, typically comes from meat, especially beef. It is acetylated so it can cross the brain-body barrier. It increases chances for pregnancy by affecting both women and men, and helps women with symptoms of polycystic ovaries. It helps with depression, autism symptoms, alcohol dependence, and various types of pain like migraines and fibromyalgia.",podcast_11,01.09.49
53,"The blood-brain and blood-gonad barriers are there to protect the brain and gonads from free-floating substances, only allowing very specific substances to come through.",podcast_11,01.11.01
54,"The digestive track is basically a long tube with mucosal lining guarding the body. Microbiota generally speaking do not care about us, just care about the good conditions that help them grow, so they will try to manipulate the gut environment in various ways, like making the mucosal lining more acidic or more basic. Some of these changes are good for us, some not, so the microbiota is not all good or bad. They also impact neurotransmitters that live in the gut, therefore impacting what is communicated to the brain.",podcast_11,01.17.37
55,"Supporting a good microbiome boosts mood, digestion and immune system and seems to help in several mental illnesses and with some features of autism. But boosting it too much can also lead to brain fog. Consuming fermented foods is the best way to boost the microbiome without boosting it too much to cause brain fog.",podcast_11,01.21.55
56,"Saccharin has been linked with damaging the microbiome balance. This is based on an article published in Nature on 2014: ""Artificial sweeteners induce glucose intolerance by altering the gut microbiota"".",podcast_11,01.25.08
57,"The microbiome shifts with different diets, but the effects are not universal. An individual's microbiome might benefit from one diet, and someone else's from a different diet. This is probably down to genetics and conditions when raised up.",podcast_11,01.28.31
58,"Processed foods trigger overconsumption of food and weight gain beyond what is explained by the extra calories consumed. So while different diets have different effects on different people, processed foods are universally bad regardless of the type of diet and person. This is based on an article published in Nature on 2014: ""Health: The weighty costs of non-caloric sweeteners"".",podcast_11,01.29.12
59,"A long fast depletes the microbiome. But when it is replenished it's usually replenished at higher levels than before. In any case the depletion has an impact on our ability to digest food and use food to impact our mood right after the fast. This is probably why people often don't feel as good right after breaking a long fast, and why it is often recomended to return to food gradually.",podcast_11,01.33.13
60,"Two groups of people were given the same milkshakes. One group was told that their shakes contained much more calories than the other group. The group thinking their shakes contained more calories had a very later dampening effect on ghrelin which controls appetite, so they felt full for longer. This is a good example of a top down psysiological effect, of emotions impacting our physiology. This comes from the work of Alia Crum.",podcast_11,01.34.58
61,"The system of motivation and reward are important for emotions because it's throught this sytem that we find (or lack) the motivation to get out of bed, to pursue things, and feel pleasure (and pain) as a result. ",podcast_12,00.06.02
62,"The neurochemistry of motivation and drive are intertwined with movement. Acetylcholine is responsible for focus in the brain, and for firing muscles to move, but the desire and urge to move is regulated by dopamine.",podcast_12,00.06.26
63,"Dopamine is a precursor of adrenaline/epinephrine. Dopamine is released by various parts of the body, but the most important for our reward system is the VTA area in the brain that drops dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. This is your accelerator for action. On the other hand, there is the prefrontal cortex which acts as a break to the effects of dopamine allowing us to regulate. Otherwise, we would constantly be a pleasure-seeking animal.",podcast_12,00.09.00
64,"Dopamine is related to our motivation and how much effort we might put to achieve something, or alternatively, opt to quit and not achieve it. It is our bias for movement and it is responsible for motivating us to achieve things we want.",podcast_12,00.07.54
65,"Food raises our baseline dopamine levels by about 50%. Sex by about 100%, nicotine by about 150%. Cocaine and amphetamines by about 1000%. Thinking of these things raises dopamine at similar levels to consuming them (this is not true for things like cocaine where the increase is so extreme). High-update video games seem to release dopamine somewhere between nicotine and cocaine. Social media gives lots of dopamine at the beginning of consumption but lowers over time.",podcast_12,00.14.17
66,About 15% to 20% of people are biologically biased towards developing addiction.,podcast_12,00.19.14
67,"Here's how cravings work. By simply thinking of something you want (chocolate), you get some dopamine. When you eat it, you get some more dopamine and at the same time a different system kicks off which is a downward deflation in pleasure (we call this pain). Craving is this two-part system with pleasure and pain each playing a role. The initial pleasure and the subsequent deflated feeling make us want more. Now every time we have more, we progressively get less pleasure, but more pain. Seeing the bigger picture, your desire for something is always the combination of the pleasure indulging into this thing and the pain of not having it.",podcast_12,00.12.19
68,"Serotonin is the molecule of bliss and contentment, primarily released by the raphe area of the brain. While dopamine makes us focus on things outside of us, driving us into action, serotonin makes us focus on the inside and the things we already have resulting in a more sedative effect. Dopamine is about wanting, serotonin is about having. ",podcast_12,00.26.08
69,"The contrasting effects of the dopamine and serotonin systems can also be seen by different drugs tapping into the different systems. Cocaine and amphetamines make people more active, wanting to pursue more things, and opioid and cannabis users tend to be more content with what they have. THC and cannabis do rise appetite sometimes but this is due to their effects on insulin and blood sugar. ",podcast_12,00.29.31
70,"Some mindfulness practices try to bridge the gap between the dopamine and serotonin systems. For example, by meditating while eating a single almond, an experience that is usually dopamine-centric (feeding) transforms into a practice of enjoying the present.",podcast_12,00.28.10
71,The goal is to have a nice balance between the dopamine and serotonin systems so you can have motivation and appreciation of life at the same time.,podcast_12,00.30.17
72,"Dopamine is not exactly pleasure, it is not helping us feel pleasure, only to achieve it via action. People with very high dopamine levels, therefore, tend to be more actively pursuing their goals. This does not mean they will be actively moving all the time. There are active and passive ways to pursue one's goals, and while some might prefer a more direct action-filled route, others might opt for more passive manipulative routes. Similarly, people will try to reach their goals in more or less ethical ways.",podcast_12,00.30.36
73,"There are two kinds of procrastinators. One kind is people who rely on the anxiety of doing something on a tight deadline, at the last minute, people who leverage their stress to achieve things. Caffeine, oxygenating breathwork, or l-tyrosine-rich foods are all things that could potentially help out such people. The second kind is people who simply do not get enough dopamine to get them into action. Such people will be better off talking to their doctor and considering mucuna pruriens or dopaminergic drugs.",podcast_12,00.32.50
74,"Dopamine is released in anticipation of as well as during the practice of sex. After orgasm, dopamine is released along with prolactin which generally prevents further sex. There is typically an antithetical effect between dopamine and prolactin, as prolactin produces a feeling of stillness, lethargy and a lack of desire to pursue more. So the dip in desire to have more sex after orgasm is not due to lack of dopamine (as we saw dopamine is released after orgasm), but due to the release of prolactin.  This period of high prolactin and low dopamine is called a refractory period and can be shortened by introducing some kind of novelty (dopamine loves novelty), let's say different sexual partners as shown in a classical experiment with chicken. All this does not only relate to sex, as prolactin is released after many intense events, like after an exam, turning in a paper, or after giving birth, which is why often after a major milestone we feel a bit depleted. Vitamin B6 and zinc inhibit prolactin, so they can help reduce this refractory period. Another way to reduce the effects of the refactory period is to try to extend the dopamine release after the event mentally, by trying not to get all the pleasure at once but drag it out, keep thinking about it and so on.",podcast_12,00.39.41
75,"Schizophrenia is related to high dopamine, and schizophrenia drugs usually block dopamine. This is why often, such treatments have side effects like tardive dyskinesia, an uncontrollable movement disorder. This is another example of how closely the dopamine system is intertwined with movement in the body.",podcast_12,00.44.25
76,"If we think something will happen but doesn't we get a big crush on dopamine. Even a maybe or a small chance of something happening can create such an expectation and lead to a dopamine crush. This is particularly evident in kids, but adults are very prone to it as well.",podcast_12,00.50.00
77,"Viewing bright light between 10pm and 4pm has a big impact on our ability to release dopamine. So the next day, we will not only be sleep deprived, but also dopamine deprived.",podcast_12,00.53.03
78,"In an experiment aiming to separate pleasure from motivation, rats with no dopamine would pull a lever to get food (pleasure). When the lever was next to them, they would pull it. When they had to move one body length to get to the lever and pull it, they wouldn't bother. Dopamine is about our motivation to get reach whatever is pleasurable, not related to enjoying the pleasure itself.",podcast_12,00.54.59
79,"PEA, an over-the-counter supplement, releases dopamine and serotonin at low levels.",podcast_12,00.58.00
80,"ADHD drugs like Aderral are very amphetamine-like so it might seem counterintuitive to use them for ADHD. The way these drugs work is by strengthening the decelerator of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, and in that way reducing impulsivity.",podcast_12,01.02.03
81,"In an experiment, it was shown that obese kids were more impulsive in general (for instance they were more willing to cross a busy road). Impulsivity at age 10 was also shown to predict obesity in adult life. As mentioned in the molecule of more book.",podcast_12,01.02.43
82,"The subjective effect is very powerful in our reward system. In an experiment, students were either given a placebo or coffee and were told they were either getting coffee or Adderall. There was an expected placebo effect, with expected significant differences between people who took and did not take coffee. The interesting thing here is that people who took coffee but thought they had taken Adderall had measurably different responses performing better in memory and focus tests than people who only took, and thought they took, coffee. This is an interesting example of how our belief in something can have a measurable effect on working performance. The study was published on Experimental Clinical Psychopharmacology in 2022: ""Expectation for stimulant type modifies caffeine's effects on mood and cognition among college students"".",podcast_12,01.05.10
83,"Caffeine can increase dopamine by about 30% and might have a protective effect on dopaminergic neurons. Still unclear what the effect of MDMA is. Methamphetamine is definitely bad for dopaminergic neurons. Unclear if nicotine protects dopaminergic neurons, but certainly increases prolactin.",podcast_12,01.09.00
84,"A peak in dopamine release (reward) will unavoidably lead to a dip, and the repetition of smaller rewards will lead to craving with diminishing pleasure and increasing associated pain, so if you want to support long-term dopamine release you should try to blunt your reward response. You should aim to lessen the intensity of single rewards (avoid getting very high pleasure to avoid the associated dip). And you should avoid celebrating every win, ideally introducing some unpredictability around when you might celebrate. A rule like avoiding to celebrate every third win will not work. This, by the way, is also what makes gambling so addictive. That said, self-reward is very important. It should be kept but managed appropriately.",podcast_12,01.12.00
85,"Emotions probably make up most of what we would consider to be the experience of life. Yet, emotions are very subjective. The way happiness feels for a person is probably a bit different to another person, just like the perception of colours we know to be different among individuals.",podcast_13,00.07.40
86,"Our language for explaining emotions is lacking. There are three basic axes which can help us understand all motions: 1) the arousal scale, how awake or alert do you feel? 2) the valence scale: is it a good or a bad feeling? and 3) the external/internal scale: how much of your focus is outside (exterocepting) or inside (interocepting)? Thinking along these lines can help us communicate but also better understand the emotions we feel. These axes are also good in helping us understand the biological basis of emotions and seem to underly most theories of emotion even when the theories themselves have significant differences between them.",podcast_13,00.20.55
87,Mood meter is an interesting app that utilises the three axes of emotions and can help you assess and predict your emotions.,podcast_13,00.18.55
88,"The two basic questions any good neuroanatomist should understand are 1) where does an area of the brain connect to (if it connects to the eye, it probably has something to do with visual input and so on), and 2) what did this area originally develop to do? Applying this concept to emotions, we will try to see what systems emotions tap into, how they are developed, and what they are developed for. So we will talk about emotions in various developmental stages including babies, adolescents and adults.",podcast_13,00.11.03
89,"There is no single area in the brain for all emotions. The limbic system has been linked to emotions in various ways, but it's just one component of many. There was a narrative that certain circuits were responsible for certain emotions (eg the circuit of sadness), but that has been challenged lately. There is much better evidence that there are separate circuits for our alertness or arousal level, the interoception & exteroception scale, and the valence scale.",podcast_13,00.12.31
90,"There is a distinction between what is happening inside of you, internal, and what is happening outside, external. As babies, we have no sense of the external world, only that it impacts the internal one, for instance, by a caretaker stepping in and making a decision like giving you food. So the baby is mainly interocepting until the caretaker steps in and the baby can now start exterocepting, and can start negotiating what it needs to do so that its needs are met, and its anxieties are lifted. This forms the fundamental rules for our emotional experience.",podcast_13,00.14.34
91,"When looking at healthy emotional development, emotions are the process of bonding with the world. Creating expectations and making predictions about the world.",podcast_13,00.18.07
92,"Classic experiment: mother (or father) and child play together for a bit, the parent leaves for a while and then returns. Most babies will cry when the parent leaves. On return, babies tend to have one of 4 kinds of responses: a) happy (secure attached), b) less likely to seek attention from the parent, eg they might stick with the researcher who stayed in the room (avoidant) c) angry (ambivalent), d) avoid everyone after the parent leaves or returns (disorganised). The experiment has been repeated in many ways and with small variations. This experiment is ultimately about the parent-child bond and how it gets reinstated. Which type of baby you were informs your emotionality now. This is based on the work of Bowlby and Ainsworth.",podcast_13,00.27.55
93,"Generally speaking, the core of a social bond is characterised by gaze, vocalisation, affect, and touch (and later with writing communication). Humans, like many other animals, have an exceptional ability to recognise facial expressions and vocalisations of people we care about that is already developed in babies.",podcast_13,00.32.21
94,"Emotional regulation is very much related to how much you are exterocepting, to how much the outside world can have an impact on your emotions, and to what extent you can recognise this effect. Shifting your focus from inside out and from outside in is something that can be helpful in many situations. For instance, in a social situation we typically want to exterocept (notice people around us) much more than interocept (does my voice sound ok, is my hair ok). In contrast, you might want to move away from exteroception when you are alone and significantly influenced by the alerts on your phone. Being able to shift your focus between interoception and exteroception is an essential skill for managing your emotions and it can be trained.",podcast_13,00.36.07
95,"A simple exercise to help you train shifting your focus between interoception and exteroception. Identify a point of external contact, like a chair you might be sitting on, and take your focus there. Then try to go a bit more inner, like your gut or heart, are you hungry, are you digesting, what is the rhythm of your breathing? Now try to purely exterocept. Focus on some relatively small point of your visual field and try to focus on it as much as you can. Try to shift your focus from the external to the internal and vice versa.",podcast_13,00.39.52
96,"The degree to which you are exterocepting and interocepting is probably very much connected with the type of baby you were (securely attached, avoiding, ambivalent, or disorganised, as discussed earlier). Although it's hard to know which type of baby we were, we can look at hints in puberty and adulthood about our emotionality.",podcast_13,00.37.23
97,Areas on the brain related to exteroception and interoception are anchored in the areas concerned with focus and attention.,podcast_13,00.43.17
98,Emotions and their intensity will change according to how much we interocept with extreme emotions of all kinds experienced interoceptively.,podcast_13,00.46.00
99,"Leptin is a hormone/peptide which is produced by body fat and signals the body has enough body fat so that metabolism can be increased to liberate more fat. For this reason, it has been associated with leanness. The absence of leptin is also responsible for how hard it is to lose the last few pounds of body fat.",podcast_13,00.48.27
100,"Puberty is a period of intense hormonal and brain changes, with the brain changes happening first and kicking off the hormonal changes. On average, it starts at around age 10 for girls and 12 for boys. The primary trigger of puberty is leptin, with enough leptin kicking off the process (fat people do not necessarily go into puberty faster).",podcast_13,00.47.31
101,A hormone is a chemical that gets secreted in one part of the body and travels to impact tissues in another part of the body. Pheromones are chemicals that are released by a member of one species that then travels and impacts other members of the same or even different species.,podcast_13,00.50.23
102,"The onset of puberty also has interesting social effects, or pheromone effects. It is debated whether there are any pheromone effects in humans, but Huberman believes there is ample evidence of them due to phenomena like the synchronization of menstrual cycles, experiments of women being able to recognise their partner's shirts via smell after many washes, and so on. In any case, there are several strong pheromone effects documented in animals around puberty. One such effect is the Vandenberg effect: the introduction of a novel mature male to a pre-mature female will cause the female to go through puberty. Another effect is the Bruce effect: a novel male showing up will cause a pregnant female to spontaneously miscarry if the father has disappeared. There is evidence these happen to animals including primates, but we are not sure about humans.",podcast_13,00.50.11
103,"One of the most interesting chemicals that triggers puberty is kisspeptin. Kisspeptin triggers GnRH, which then triggers LH, which travels across the body and finally triggers the ovaries to produce more estrogen and the testes to produce more testosterone. Kisspeptin also allows the circulation of high quantities of hormones that would normally be restricted in adults. For this reason, kisspeptin is also used by athletes who use hormones for performance enhancement and in therapeutic endocrinology.",podcast_13,00.56.34
104,"Puberty is a transition from generalists to specialists, which is mainly due to the decrease in neuroplasticity in the brain during that time. This is important for all brain functions, and it is important for emotionality as well.",podcast_13,00.58.22
105,"Another large aspect of puberty is the formation of emotional and social bonds, which is also what mostly preoccupies people going through puberty. The adolescent explores the matching of internal needs and the external world with much more agency refining how they relate to social structures, who they can rely on and what kind of relying predictions they can make.",podcast_13,00.59.30
106,"During puberty, there is a strong desire for action away from the main caregiver. The adolescent will return, but they will want to spend increasingly more time away. This is true for animals, primates, as well as humans. Puberty does not only change our brains, bodies, and hormones, it also creates a bias for dispersal.",podcast_13,01.01.37
107,"During puberty, there is an increased connection between the prefrontal cortex (which is involved in motivation, decision-making, and allows us to suppress action in order to achieve longer-term goals), dopamine centres, and the amygdala. So a lot of activity in centres related to decisions, emotions, and rewards. This is a period of testing behaviours and their outcomes, with a much increased agency and ability.",podcast_13,01.04.20
108,"Intervention strategies to promote healthy adolescence and puberty (as published on Nature in 2018, ""Importance of investing in adolescence from a developmental science perspective""): a) learn to mitigate the risk of famine and malnutrition (could i feed/support myself?), b) later start time in schools to match their changing circadian rhythms, c) better sleep interventions where needed to prevent and battle mental health issues, d) levering social connections for positive behaviour reinforcement, e) encourage as many forms of safe interactions as possible to aid the adolescent's autonomy (expand the buffet of experiences from whatever the caretakers bring to the table). These can be used as guidelines for parents, but also for other adults to remember what we went through and to evaluate whether we were allowed to go through all these.",podcast_13,01.03.18
109,"A healthy emotional development clearly starts with the baby and caretaker spending peaceful time together, with a lot of gaze, vocalisation, affect and touch building a bond through oxytocin and serotonin. But also through the ability to get excited together through dopamine. This back and forth between the dopaminergic and serotoninergic states is key to all relationships later on as well. This comes from the work of Allan Schore.",podcast_13,01.11.21
110,"The left brain is language dominant, and a bit better at math (at least for right-handed people). The right brain is good at spatial information. The right brain is a bit primitive linguistically but good at understanding the lilting of language, the ups and downs when speaking.",podcast_13,01.14.15
111,"Oxytocin is released in response to lactation, following sex, and by non-sexual touch, and is particularly involved in pair bonding. It has a calming effect but also raises alertness to the emotional state of others. It increases the synchronicity of emotions. In this way, oxytocin helps us predict the behaviour of others and guide our own actions.",podcast_13,01.18.30
112,"Mirror neurons, are neurons that fire during an action (let's say lifting a pen) but also fire when we witness that action (someone else lifting a pen). They have been observed in animals and humans, but they are a very controversial topic. Some scientists are not convinced they exist, while Huberman believes they exist, but that they are not directly involved with the emotion and empathy systems. We do know, however, that there are neurons involved in trying to predict the behaviour of others, so we should focus on them and look into molecules like Oxytocin.",podcast_13,01.20.11
113,"In studies, taking oxytocin has been shown to increase positive communication among couples during a fight (Biological Psychiatry, 2009). Men report more intimacy and connection after sex. Autistic children established better social connections. Men in monogamous relationships would pay less visual attention to other attractive potential partners (Neuroscience).",podcast_13,01.23.12
114,"Vitamin-D is needed for the production of oxytocin, and supplementing with vitamin-D sometimes leads to increased oxytocin. Melatonin might have some effects in raising oxytocin as well. Of course, there are also people who supplement with oxytocin directly, but Huberman would advise against that.",podcast_13,01.26.59
115,"Vasopressin is a molecule that suppresses urination, boosts memory and promotes a feeling of giddy love. As such it has been used as an aphrodisiac, as a treatment for symptoms of excessive urination and as a bio-hack mental performance tool. It has also been shown that a type of rodent species would be either very monogamous or not monogamous at all, depending on the individual's levels of Vasopressin, with similar effects reported anecdotally in humans. As a side note, alcohol inhibits vasopressin which makes you want to urinate more. Huberman would not recommend supplementing with vasopressin because of the many and robust effects this molecule has on the body.",podcast_13,01.28.35
116,"Stimulation of the vagus nerve leads to increased alertness and dopamine release (David McCormick in Current Biology, 2021). In a psychiatric session where the patient's vagus nerve was stimulated it was demonstrated how through the stimulation, the patient went from feeling very depressed and unmotivated to appearing almost cheerful and recounting events with excitement (from the work of Karl Deisseroth as cited on a New Yorker article, 2015). This is just another example of how stimulating the vagus nerve leads to alertness and dopamine release. More interestingly, it is an example of how the axis of alertness is so important to emotion.",podcast_13,01.30.40
