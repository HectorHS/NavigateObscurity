1,3,"Everything you do antagonises for energy. Mitochondria are your power plants, and energy needs to be constantly produced - it cannot be stored for longer than a couple of seconds. "
2,4,"Not enough energy in the brain (because the rest of the body is consuming it) causes brain fatigue which results in tiredness, lack of focus, moodiness, fogginess, and cravings. This is why it's essential to think about energy consumption and efficiency in the whole body.  "
3,6,"The reptilian brain is present in all vertebrae and is responsible for basic functions like temperature control. The labrador brain (Dave Asprey's term I think) is present in all mammals and governs the 4 f's: fight, flight, feed, fuck. In humans, it also imposes an unnecessary state of alertness and distraction. Lastly, the human brain is uniquely capable of resisting/fighting such urges which requires decision making and you only get a finite amount of those.  "
4,6,Myelin builds insulation around neurons for faster transmissions.
5,9,"Fat and sugar are alternative energy fuels. If you only use sugar for energy, fat is stored and you get sugar crashes as you run out of sugar and keep craving more. "
6,10,Toxins and allergens are harder to neutralise/metabolise for the liver and kidneys so these organs need extra energy to function when toxins are present.
7,10,Adrenaline creates extra energy by breaking down muscles and getting sugar. Insulin production is also triggered to break down the sugar.
8,12,"Using sugar as the main energy fuel slowly builds some insulin resistance. Developing insulin resistance over time makes you inefficient in breaking down sugar and using it as fuel for energy production. So the idea is to switch to fat-fueled energy, if not permanently, at least intermittently."
9,13,"The mitochondria create ATP which is our power source. To produce energy, ATP is broken down, and mitochondria recreat it from its components in super small cycles. "
10,15,"High cortisol levels (stressed) promote the usage of sugar for energy production. The problem is that high levels of insulin (which helps to break down sugar) cause cortisol release, which causes sugar burning which needs more insulin and so on. "
11,16,Mitogenesis is the production of new mitochondria.
12,17,"Testosterone and thyroid boost mitochondria function, while the mitochondria produce the 'parent' hormone (pregnenolone) of testosterone and estrogen creating a feedback loop. This loop degrades with age. In extreme mitochondrial dysfunction intake of hormones can help to break the circle. "
13,18,"Apparently, due to increased chemicals/toxins in our environment in the modern world, we need 50-100% more energy now than 100 years ago. "
14,20,"Chronic stress is linked with poor fat metabolism and increased demand for sugar, so it does not promote efficient use of energy. On the other hand, short-term stress can help in generating more mitochondria, and boost natural detoxification processes to improve energy efficiency. "
15,22,Neurons are massive energy suckers. So the brain really needs a lot of energy and easily suffers in the absence of it. 
16,22,The thyroid also contributes to the good function of oligodendroglia which are the producers of myelin that insulate neurons/transmissions. 
17,23,Cholesterol is needed for the production of myelin. A fasting-like diet also helps. 
18,25,"Apart from the environment, toxins can be introduced as mitochondrial energy-production by-products. The mitochondria also produce antioxidants to battle those free radicals. "
19,26,Oxidative stress occurs when free radicals/toxins are not adequately neutralised by the body's detoxification processes. 
20,28,"To boost neuron production, avoid oxidised fats, toxins and sugar. Boost intake of omega-3 fats, and bioflavonoids. Avoid long-term stress but seek short-term stress. Exercise (partly due to short-term stress), have fun engaging with the environment, get unfiltered sunlight, and have sex. "
21,29,"Chronic inflammation is a major issue as it is associated with major diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and autism, plus acne, forgetfulness, fatigue, and brain fog. Cytokines (inflammation products) impact brain functions, primarily the prefrontal cortex. It doesn't matter where the inflammation is. Many ageing symptoms can be seen as inflammation symptoms. "
22,30,"Food sensitivities cause inflammation responses that when chronic become problematic (bloating, brain fog). The gut bacteria are directly relevant. The fewer of them, (killed by antibiotics, pesticides, processed foods etc) the more irritatable the gut."
23,30,The blood-brain barrier that restricts access to the brain is partly regulated by butyrate which is produced in the gut. Grass-fed butter is the best source for it. Less of it means random particles make it into the brain which causes inflammation due to the body's response.
24,30,"Bacteroidetes are rarer than firmicute (like yoghurt cultures), and a good balance between them is associated with reduced inflammation and leaner people. To grow bacteroidetes, increase your polyphenols intake. "
25,31,"For Asprey, a polyphenol-rich diet has the best results in enforcing gut lining."
26,32,The VIP hormone is important for the inflammation response. 
27,32,"Eicosanoids help regulate inflammation. The ones coming from omega-3 are anti-inflammatory. Those coming from omega-6 are pro-inflammatory. The aim here is to find a good balance. Omega 6's can be found in all vegetable oils, and because they are everywhere the balance is rarely good."
28,33,"A negative charge in cells is important for firing neurons. Oxidation reduces negative charge. Also, flying. Grounding has the opposite effect."
29,34,UV light increases cognitive performance probably due to the positive impact on EZ water. 
30,35,"Polyphenols help gut bacteria boost neurogenesis, regulate apoptosis (cell death), and decrease inflammation. "
31,36,"Foods rich in polyphenols are dark purple or red vegetables, coffee, dark chocolate, blueberries, pomegranates, and grapes. Use coffee to boost absorption. Don't use milk as it blocks absorption."
32,38,"Sufficient neurotransmitters are needed for efficient communication between neurons. Special focus on boosting dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, l-tryptophan, melatonin, acetylcholine, and GABA. "
33,40,"Dopamine makes neurons less likely to fire and is linked with the reward system. Too little is linked with Parkinson's and social anxiety. More is linked with better decision-making and performance. Precursors for dopamine production include beef, chicken, almonds, wild salmon, avocados, and sunlight."
34,41,"Norepinephrine helps form memories, relieves pain and signals the production of antioxidants, particularly glutathione. Precursors for production are vitamin C and dopamine. "
35,42,Serotonin is key to our mood. Too little is linked with depression and anger. Serotonin is also indirectly linked with sleep. The precursor for serotonin production is L-tryptophan. 
36,44,"Precursors for l-tryptophan production are meats, salmon, cashews, almonds, and hazelnuts. "
37,45,"Acetylcholine stimulates muscles and is needed for REM sleep and temperature control. Too little is linked with Alzheimer's, tiredness and worse sleep. Too much is linked with muscle tension (tight jaw, grinding teeth etc). "
38,46,Two precursors for acetylcholine that are best consumed together beef/pork/lamb with egg/beef/salmon/kidney/liver. 
39,47,"GABA is important for the development of neurons and regulating their firing (inhibiting) producing a calming effect. Too little is linked with anxiety disorders, panic attacks etc. "
40,48,"Precursors for GABA production are meats, salmon, and eggs. "
41,49,Saturated fat is best (less chance of oxidation - more stable) but some unsaturated fat is also essential like omega 3's and 6's. DHA from omega 3 is particularly important as one of the main building ingredients of the brain that cannot be produced by the body.
42,49,"Great sources of stable saturated fats are grass-fed butter and meat, which contain much better ratios of omega 3's, saturated fat and CLA's (improved brain function, causes weight loss and reduces risk of cancer). There is a great difference between grass-fed and grain-fed products. "
43,51,Egg yolks are a great source of stable saturated fats. Grass-fed yolks are twice as nutritious. Runny yolks (not hard-boiled) for better cholesterol. 
44,53,Olive oil is the best source of monounsaturated fat. It also contains oleocanthal and oleuropein which are both great antioxidants. Be careful as it can be easily damaged by heat and light exposure. 
45,54,"The best sources of omega-3s are wild-caught fish, especially salmon, sardines, anchovies, mackerel, trout, and fish or krill oil.  "
46,54,"Fasting, or severe carb restriction leads to ketosis where the liver, in the absence of other energy sources, breaks down fat into ketones for fuel. Ketosis also increases GABA production, and heart energy by 28%, so should do something similar to the brain (although, there is no proof yet). "
47,57,"Ketones are a much better energy fuel, faster with fewer by-products and more efficient ATP production. "
48,57,"Extended ketosis can raise cortisol, and disrupt sleep and thyroid levels. Also, the transition period into ketosis is not fun.  "
49,60," Sufficient quantities of MCT oils trigger ketosis even if carbs are around (but have disaster pants effect). Alternatively, to trigger ketosis have < 20 grams of carbs a day and 70-85 of calories from fat which is probably short on polyphenols and other nutrients."
50,60,"Beyond ketosis, fasting is good for myelination, autophagy, and reduced inflammation, but is bad for mood. A hack attempt to keep the best of both worlds is intermittent fasting. Only eat in a window of 6-8 hours, which is also good for neurogenesis, but you might get into energy slumps. Bulletproof coffee can help by providing much-needed energy."
51,60,"Use an allergy blood panel for food sensitivities. Alternatively, check your heart rate about 90 min after consumption for an increase of around 17 beats per minute. "
52,63,"The trans fats in processed foods and fried food (especially reused oil) cause mitochondrial damage, inflammation, and an overactive immune system, effects that last a couple of days. "
53,64,"Dairy contains lactose (sugar) and casein (protein with a similar structure to gluten, which is why it usually affects gluten-intolerant people). Milk protein causes inflammation and prevents the usage of polyphenols. "
54,64,"Gluten leads to the over-release of zonulin which leads to leaky gut, inflammation and thyroid imbalance. "
55,66,"Vegetable oils are too unstable and have too many omega 6's. A good balance is one omega 3 for every four omega 6's, and the Western diet has way too many omega 6's. "
56,67,"Mould cripples mitochondrial performance, so it's important to avoid it. OTA, one of the worst mould toxins, is typically found in rich polyphenol foods. "
57,68,"Mould toxins are found in Cereals and grains mostly due to storing practices. There is about a 42% chance your cereal has it. Don't only avoid it yourself, avoid eating animals that have been fed these (eg chicken)."
58,69,"Mould toxins are commonly found in coffee, mostly due to processing / storing practices. Mostly OTA but also other toxins. OTA is not regulated in the US. Look for single blend, high elevation, south African varieties ideally, as they are more resistant to mould. "
59,70,Mould toxins are commonly found in dried fruit which are also often sprayed with chemicals. 
60,70,"About 50% of all wine has the OTA mould toxin, check the bulletproof site for a list of safe wines. "
61,71,Beer contains OTA mould toxin from the grains it is produced. 
62,74,Chocolate contains some OTA mould toxin. European chocolate is better. 
63,74,"Mould toxins are found in nuts, especially peanuts. The best nuts are the ones that come in their shells. "
64,74,About a fourth of all corn is contaminated with mould toxins. This is problematic because corn is everywhere. Mostly a result of pesticides making fungi hyperactive. 
65,74,MSG is a food additive which is a toxin damaging mitochondria by over-firing neurons and depleting energy (when too many). 
66,77,"Sweeteners, additives, and flavourings have enough hurtful effects on mental performance to brand them as neurotoxins. Additionally, they are typically added to already inflammatory foods so there is an extra reason to avoid them. "
67,77,"Aspartame is over-firing neurons, damaging mitochondria, and negatively impacting gut bacteria. "
68,78,Soy sauce contains tyramine and histamine which can impair mitochondrial functions and cause inflammation. Also contains some MSG and may contain mould toxins. 
69,80,"Fluoride lowers thyroid function, so double-check your tap water. "
70,81,GMOs are harmful mostly due to pesticides containing organophosphates which heavily impact mitochondrial functions and break down acetylcholine. 
71,82,"Mercury depletes antioxidants and causes inflammation, cell damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction."
72,83,Insulin is used in neurotransmission so insulin resistance leads to inefficient neurons. 
73,83,"Sugar can make you moody, it reduces dopamine receptors and increases inflammation. Fructose is the worst kind due to oxidative stress and the reduced oxidation defences in cells. Sugar is linked with many degenerative illnesses like Alzheimer's. "
74,84,"Coconut oil is a good source of saturated fat. Most MCT in it does not really act as an MCT, instead, it causes inflammation. It does contain some great MCTs but in very low potencies (<10%). Extracts like brain octane make use of these. "
75,86,"Frying, grilling and smoking meat produces HCA + PAH which impair mitochondrial functions, induce oxidative damage and prevent apoptosis. Both substances are carcinogenic, possibly due to the apoptosis effect. Proteins can get damaged and not function as well (but not toxic). "
76,87,"Cooking fats (oxidised) produce suboptimal cell membranes, mitochondria fuel, and myelin, and cause inflation. Asprey avoids cooking with fat almost entirely. "
77,87,"For protection against mould, mould-test your house/environment, avoid intaking mould from food, and battle with supplements if/when consumed. "
78,88,"Heavy metals are toxins that impair mitochondria and can be found in the air, water, and food products. "
79,88,"Arsenic is carcinogenic and neurotoxic. It is found in many pesticides,/herbicides from where it gets into the groundwater, then the seawater, and eventually seafood. It is also found in glass, metal, and paint in buildings. Brown rice is 8x more potent in arsenic than white rice. "
80,89,"Cadmium impairs mitochondria and increases oxidative stress. It is found in some grains, steel plating, and glass pigment (but not that much any more). "
81,90,"Lead impairs mitochondrial functions and can be found in old paint, and sometimes water (from pipes)."
82,91,"Mercury causes fatigue, depression, irritation, memory/focus issues, and nerve degeneration. It is found in seawater, and by extension in fish and seafood. It is also found in fluorescent bulbs when broken. "
83,92,A study on 550 drugs (prescribed) showed that 34% of them damage mitochondria. 
84,93,Antibiotics damage mitochondria (which have after all developed from bacteria). Supplement with glutathione for extra protection when you need to take them. 
85,93,"Anticonvulsants, antidepressants, barbiturates, cholesterol medication, aspirin, acetaminophen, antiarrhythmics, antivirals (interferon), cancer medication, diabetes medication, and beta blockers, all have some negative impact on mitochondrial functions. "
86,93,"The body has a highly evolved and complicated detox system to fight all kinds of toxins. Very varied from person to person (most varied), but can be made stronger. By providing nutrients needed, and by encouraging certain processes like sweating and breaking down fat as toxins get stored there. "
87,95,A sauna is a helpful detox practice due to sweating. Infrared ones are even better due to the benefit to mitochondria and the ability to stay longer. But remember to drink lots of fluids and salt. 
88,96,"Exercise is a great detox practice due to the combination of sweating, increased lipolysis (more toxins released from broken down fat), and increased circulation useful in breaking down toxins. If you experience brain fog after, supplement with a toxin-binding substance. "
89,97,Chelation therapy is very effective for detoxing heavy metals but could be dangerous if the kidney or liver is already damaged by heavy metals. 
90,97,Improved circulation reduces inflammation. Better oxygen delivery boosts energy production and detoxification processes. 
91,98,Chlorella is a toxin-binding algae. Good for when eating fish with heavy metals. 
92,98,"The visual system consumes about ~15% of the energy budget. In fact, detecting shades of grey is a good test for mitochondrial function. Unusual spectrums of light take excess energy to process. "
93,,"Too much ultraviolet light is bad, but some is needed to activate vitamin D and help in the circadian rhythm.  "
94,,"Fluorescent and LED light bulbs have much reduced infrared, red and violet light and too much blue. So they are missing a lot of beneficial light, and have too much unusual and expensive to process light (blue).  "
95,,Daylight supports the production of serotonin. Serotonin also breaks down to melatonin needed for sleep. 
96,,"EZ-water supports mitochondrial function so should be plentiful within cells. Toxins and junk light alter the structure of this water. Natural light and vegetables help produce it. Exposure to unobscured natural light is best. In artificial light, make sure you get enough red/infrared frequencies. "
97,,"Switch to halogen lamps or supplement blue-rich light with red LED, UV, and infrared-rich lamps. Outdoor light is the best. But need direct contact with the skin for full benefits (no tinted glass, sun cream etc)."
98,,Collagen is the main structural protein in the body. The growth of both collagen and mitochondria is boosted by infrared and red light.  
99,,"People with Irlen syndrome have trouble with certain frequencies, with possibly up to 50% of people affected. Such individuals are sensitive enough that a contrast like reading a book and driving at night can lead to chronic stress from visual processing leading to eye strain, fatigue, headaches, focus troubles, dizziness, and reading difficulties. There are special glasses that can help counter these symptoms. "
100,,"Oxygen is needed for energy production so intake is important. Funnily, restricting intake, makes consumption more efficient or toughened. Eliminate the weak, train the strong. This is why high-altitude training is beneficial. Hypoxia also increases BDNF production. "
101,,Asprey suggests using Wim Hoff's breathing techniques to enforce more efficient energy production.
102,,"Use cold exposure to force thermogenesis, burn fat, improve thyroid function, increase testosterone, growth hormone, norepinephrine and PGC-1 production, stimulate autophagy, increase insulin sensitivity, and reduce inflammation."
103,,"Cold therapy is good for strengthening the vagus nerve, a central part of the parasympathetic nervous system which connects the brain to the heart, stomach, lungs, and other organs. The stronger it is the faster you can calm down after the flight or fight response. It also helps shut down inflammation faster."
104,,The lymphatic system clears out waste and toxins from the body relying on muscle movements and EZ water. The glymphatic system has the same function for the brain. 
105,,The glymphatic system is highly active in sleep. Brain cells shrink during sleep to aid (by making space) in cleansing out cellular waste and neurotoxins. All this is powered by mitochondria.  
106,,"During sleep, we produce more growth hormone, brain cell connections are strengthened and memory is improved. "
107,,The growth hormone stimulates neurogenesis and mitochondrial growth. 
108,,"Consistent poor sleep disturbs blood sugar levels, which leads to cravings, mood swings and so on. "
109,,Boost mitochondria to make the glymphatic process more efficient to get a better quality of sleep and ultimately need less of it. 
110,,"It is known that meditation has important benefits as it has been correlated with intelligence, complex thoughts, body awareness, concentration, problem-solving, lowered stress and structural changes in the brain. On a physiological level, meditation reduces levels of adrenaline and cortisol. "
111,,"When meditating, it is best to use some kind of real-time feedback for objective clarity and to keep you on track. There are various machines to achieve this tracking brain waves or blood flow. 40 Years of Zen is an extreme example of this. "
112,,"BDNF improves neurogenesis, neuroprotection, cell survival, synaptic plasticity, and memories. "
113,,"Neurogenesis is the creation of new neurons. A high rate is linked with cognitive enhancement, learning, problem-solving, and resilience against stress, anxiety and depression. "
114,,"Exercise, especially HIIT, releases PGC-1 and FNDC5, decreases BMP (which reduces neurogenesis) and increases noggin which increases it, and increases mTOR which helps weed out the weak mitochondria and train the strong. "
115,,"PGC-1 contributes to regulating mitochondrial generation, and metabolism, and raises FNDC5 production which leads to more BDNF.  "
116,,"Regular exercise lowers blood sugar and increases insulin sensitivity, endorphin production, and circulation. "
117,,Daily functional movement (even walking) could be even more beneficial to the brain than infrequent bursts of exercise.
118,,"Resistance training decreases anxiety, and fatigue, and improves memory, cognition, happiness, lymphatic movement (detox), testosterone, and growth hormone. It is stressing the body to make it better so give it enough rest. About once a week at best. Too much raises cortisol levels and BDNF drops. "
119,,Endurance training boosts BDNF in a more long-term way. 3-4 times a week is ideal.  
120,,"HIIT training is a combination of the two (endurance and resistance) that the author favours. Not much comparative data, although it seems it's better at increasing growth hormone than either of the others alone. "
121,,To increase cardiac fitness (ejection fraction - heart pump volume) you need high-intensity cardio. Medium intensity might actually decrease it. Sprint (eg 400m) rest a minute (walk or lay down) and repeat to failure. 
122,,"Vibration side effect of exercise is good for EZ water and cellular health. You can also use vibrating gear for the same effect or trampoline! Or maybe even vibrations from sound can have similar benefits but there is not much scientific validation for this yet, despite the many hacks out there. "
123,,"Melanin, when exposed to light or vibrations (exercise in sunlight is the perfect combo) can break down water to produce oxygen which can be used for energy production."
124,,Melanin is made from polyphenols.
125,,Coffee contains both polyphenols and melanin. 
126,,"Blending coffee with butter is more beneficial than having them separately. Not sure why, but the hypothesis is that it has something to do with EZ water production. "
