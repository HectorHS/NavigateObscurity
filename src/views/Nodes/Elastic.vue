            Are you interested in becoming more creative or imaginative? Better at dealing with ambiguity, contradictions, 
            and more able to adapt to change? Ready to challenge some of your well-rooted assumptions while you are at it? 
            Turns out there is a coherent way of thinking that can help you with all that. Itâ€™s called elastic thinking.
